    Community discussions suggest that a previously available SCIM API was deprecated
    or is broken, particularly for integrations like Azure AD. [33] While some IdP
    documentation mentions SCIM, it often requires a custom connector and may not
e supported out-of-the-box.

  user_management_api_authentication_acquisition_steps: 'NetSuite uses a method called
    Token-Based Authentication (TBA), which is an implementation of OAuth 1.0a. Here
    are the steps to acquire the necessary credentials:

    1.  **Enable Features:** An administrator must go to `Setup > Company > Enable
    Features` and on the `SuiteCloud` subtab, enable `TOKEN-BASED AUTHENTICATION`,
    `REST WEB SERVICES`, and any other necessary SuiteTalk or SuiteScript features.
    [11, 17]

    2.  **Create an Integration Record:** Navigate to `Setup > Integration > Manage
    Integrations > New`. Provide a name, ensure `Token-Based Authentication` is checked,
    and save. NetSuite will generate a **Consumer Key** and **Consumer Secret**.
    Save these immediately as they will not be shown again. [16, 17]

    3.  **Create a Dedicated Role:** Go to `Setup > Users/Roles > Manage Roles >
    New`. Create a new role for the integration. On the `Permissions` subtab, under
    `Setup`, add `REST Web Services`, `Log in using Access Tokens`, and `User Access
    Tokens`. Add other necessary permissions for the records the integration needs
    to access (e.g., Employees, Customers). [17, 18]

    4.  **Assign the Role to a User:** Assign the newly created role to a specific
    user (often a dedicated integration user). This can be done on the Employee record''s
    `Access` subtab. [7, 15]

    5.  **Create an Access Token:** Navigate to `Setup > Users/Roles > Access Tokens
    > New`. Select the Integration Record, the User, and the Role you created in
    the previous steps. Give the token a name and save. NetSuite will generate a **Token
    ID** and **Token Secret**. Save these immediately. [6, 16]

    These four values (Consumer Key, Consumer Secret, Token ID, Token Secret) are
    used to sign API requests. [6]'
