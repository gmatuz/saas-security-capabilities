    The following steps apply to Ivanti Service Manager (ISM) / Neurons for ITSM:
    1. Log in to the Ivanti Service Manager tenant as an Administrator.
    2. Navigate to the Configuration Console by clicking the wrench icon.
    3. Go to "Configure" > "Security Controls" > "API Keys".
    4. Click "Add New Key Group" to create a new group for your integration. Provide a name and set the Time-to-Live (TTL) for keys in this group.
    5. Within the newly created key group, click "Add API Key".
    6. Provide a description for the key.
    7. Select the user account that will be associated with this key. This user's permissions and role will determine the API's access level. It is best practice to create a dedicated integration user with the principle of least privilege.
    8. Click "Save". The API key will be generated and displayed. Copy it immediately as it may not be shown again.
    9. The API key is used in the "Authorization" header with the format: `rest_api_key=YOUR_API_KEY_HERE`.
