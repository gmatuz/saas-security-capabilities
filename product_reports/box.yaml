    value: Box supports SAML 2.0 for Single Sign-On, integrating with various Identity
      Providers like Okta, Azure AD, Google Cloud, and others. It supports both IdP-initiated
      and SP-initiated flows. [1, 38]

    value: User provisioning capabilities are generally associated with Business and
      Enterprise plans, which are the same tiers that support SSO and IdP integration.
      Microsoft's documentation for configuring provisioning also implies an enterprise
      context. [35]

  scim_authentication_mechanisms:
    value: Authentication token
    reference: https://developer.box.com/guides/authentication/
  scim_authentication_acquisition_steps: |-
    SCIM for Box is typically configured within an Identity Provider (IdP) like Azure AD or Okta. The authentication is handled by the API integration configured in the IdP, which uses OAuth 2.0 or JWT.
    1. In your IdP (e.g., Azure AD), navigate to the Enterprise Applications section and select your Box application.
    2. Go to the "Provisioning" tab.
    3. Set the Provisioning Mode to "Automatic".
    4. In the "Admin Credentials" section, click "Authorize". This will open a Box login prompt.
    5. Sign in with a Box Admin account to grant the IdP permission to manage users.
    6. The IdP securely stores the authorization token to make SCIM API calls to Box.
  user_management_api_support:

  user_management_api_licensing_level:
    value: Access to the Box API for custom development is available with all plans,
      including free developer accounts. However, to manage enterprise users (Managed
      Users), an application must be authorized within a paid Business or Enterprise
      account.

  user_management_api_authentication_mechanisms:
    value: Authentication token
    reference: https://developer.box.com/guides/authentication/
  user_management_api_authentication_acquisition_steps: |-
    For server-to-server user management, JWT is the recommended method.
    1. **Create a Box Developer Account:** Sign up at box.com/developers.
    2. **Create a Custom App:** In the Developer Console, create a new "Custom App".
    3. **Select JWT Authentication:** Choose "Server Authentication (with JWT)" as the authentication method.
    4. **Configure App Scopes:** In the "Configuration" tab, grant the necessary permissions like "Manage users" and "Manage groups".
    5. **Generate a Key Pair:** Under "Add and Manage Public Keys", click "Generate a Public/Private Keypair". This will download a JSON configuration file containing your client ID, client secret, and other necessary credentials. Securely store this file.
    6. **Admin Authorization:** A Box Admin for your enterprise must authorize the application. In the Admin Console under "Apps" > "Custom Apps", the admin clicks "Authorize New App" and provides the app's Client ID (from the downloaded JSON file).
    7. **Use the JSON config:** The downloaded JSON file is used with Box SDKs to instantiate an API client that will automatically handle token generation and refresh.
