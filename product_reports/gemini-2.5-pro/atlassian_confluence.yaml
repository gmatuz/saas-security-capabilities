  user_management_api_authentication_mechanisms:
    reference: https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/confluence/rest/v1/intro/#authentication
    value: OAuth 2.0 is a supported mechanism for REST API authentication to access
      Confluence resources. API tokens can also be used for authentication with Confluence
      Cloud, and Personal Access Tokens for Server/Data Center. The User management
      REST API (Lifecycle) mentions the 'lifecycle.enablement' privilege.
  user_management_api_licensing_level:
    reference: https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/confluence/rest/v1/api-group-user-lifecycle/#api-group-user-lifecycle
    value: Uncertain. The documentation for the User management REST API (Lifecycle)
      does not explicitly state licensing level requirements, but mentions that the
      permission to use the deactivation/activation resources is exposed by the 'lifecycle.enablement'
      privilege.
  user_management_api_support:
    reference: https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/confluence/rest/v1/api-group-user-lifecycle/
    value: yes - Confluence provides REST APIs for user lifecycle management, including
      deactivating, activating, deleting, and canceling deletion of user accounts.
      While SCIM is the preferred method for automated provisioning, a non-SCIM API
      exists for user lifecycle actions. There are also APIs to check content and
      space permissions for users and groups.

        for REST/XML-RPC related issues, specific lines in `log4j.properties` and
        `web.xml` need to be uncommented or added. Confluence Data Center writes audit
        logs which can include the method (Browser or API). Atlassian Cloud security
        alerts can be sent via webhooks. Panther can fetch Atlassian audit logs by
        querying the Atlassian Organizations REST API. The Confluence MCP Server provides
        API tools for Confluence operations and enables AI agents to interact with
        Confluence content via the MCP protocol. [1, 9, 12, 14, 35]

      value: Atlassian Confluence records login attempts (successful and failed) and
        logout events. For Confluence Data Center, audit logs contain details like
        IP address, load balancer/proxy IP address, Node ID, and method (Browser or
        API). In Confluence Cloud, audit logs include information about the actor's
        name and profile picture. On the free plan of Confluence Cloud, audit logs
        are not available. [1, 3, 5, 23]
  event_logs_licensing_level:
    reference: https://support.atlassian.com/confluence-cloud/docs/view-the-audit-log/

      and `seraph-config.xml` that control when a session is lost (e.g., after idle
      time or browser closure), there is no direct API found to programmatically invalidate
      all or specific active user sessions for incident response. Manually, administrators
      can end secure administrator sessions by clicking 'Drop access' in the banner,
      but this does not log them out of Confluence entirely.

  revoke_api_key_api:
    reference: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wjn0hW0ODOc
    value: It is possible to revoke individual API tokens or all API tokens for an
      Atlassian account through the Atlassian Administration interface by navigating
      to Security > User API tokens. The process involves selecting the tokens and
      choosing 'Revoke tokens'. Additionally, the 'Delete API token API' can automate
      this process. API tokens created before December 15, 2024, will expire in one
      year after March 13, 2025. New API tokens can be created with defined expiration
      dates and specific scopes for Jira or Confluence.
  session_timeout_configuration:
    reference: https://commission.europa.eu/cookies-policy_en
    value: Confluence session timeout can be configured by editing the `web.xml` file
      located in `<confluence-install>/conf/web.xml` and `<confluence-install>/confluence/WEB-INF/web.xml`.
      The `session-timeout` parameter is configured in minutes. Additionally, the
      `seraph.confluence` cookie's lifecycle can be changed in `seraph-config.xml`.
      Setting the session timeout to a minimum value like 15 minutes is possible,
      though the default is often 60 minutes. The `max-age` for cookies is configured
      in seconds.
  suspend_user_api:
    reference: https://www.youtube.com/supported_browsers?next_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DzXg5R-kXJd0
    value: Atlassian Confluence does not currently have a direct REST API to suspend
      or deactivate a user. Workarounds include using legacy RPC API methods or manipulating
      database entries (not recommended). However, the 'Bulk User Management for Jira
      by miniOrange' marketplace app provides functionality to suspend, reactivate,
      and deactivate users, including automatic deactivation based on last login activity.
      For managed Atlassian accounts, there is a SCIM API endpoint `/scim/directory/{directoryId}/Users/{userId}`
      which can be used to deactivate a user by setting `active:false` in the operations
      request body. This requires being a 'Verified Org Admin' and using an Admin
      API Key.

    value: Atlassian Confluence offers a REST API to retrieve information about the
      currently logged-in user, which includes display name, userKey, and account
      ID. This API confirms the user's existence and active login status. For broader
      user status (active vs. deactivated), the `deactivateusers` REST API provides
      endpoints to list active users or deactivate specific users, as well as remove
      all groups for a user, indicating whether users are currently active or not.
      Audit logs also record user creation, deletion, and modification, which can
      be used to track user status changes. The 'Bulk User Management for Jira by
      miniOrange' app can also export all users, including their active state.
  user_toggle_api:
    reference: https://www.youtube.com/supported_browsers?next_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DzXg5R-kXJd0
    value: Uncertain. While there isn't a direct API to toggle a user's status that
      explicitly mentions disabling active sessions, deactivating a user via the SCIM
      API (`active:false`) would likely impact their ability to log in and use Confluence.
      The 'Bulk User Management for Jira by miniOrange' app offers suspending and
      deactivating users, which would effectively disable their access.
