    value: uncertain - The documentation does not explicitly state specific license
      level requirements for SSO. However, it mentions premium integration options
      and app certification for connecting to more than 25 tenants.
  sso_support:
    reference: https://developer.xero.com/documentation/guides/oauth2/overview/
    value: yes - OpenID Connect, OAuth 2.0. Xero acts as an identity provider, and
      supports Sign In with Xero for users to log in with their Xero account. It leverages
      security features like two-step authentication and anomalous login detection.
      Xero's API supports the authorization code grant type using standard authorization
      code flow or PKCE extension. It also has a premium integration option called
      Custom Connections which uses the client credentials grant type. Xero provides
      an OpenID Connect Discovery configuration file for OAuth 2.0 libraries. Xero
      SSO can also be integrated with various Identity Providers (IdPs) through AuthDigital,
      supporting SAML 2.0, OAuth, and OpenID Connect protocols.
  user_management_api_authentication_acquisition_steps:
    reference: https://developer.xero.com/documentation/guides/oauth2/auth-flow/
    value: 1. Set up your app in the Xero developer portal to get your client ID and
      client secret. 2. For standard flow, your app redirects users to a Xero authorization
      URL with `client_id`, `redirect_uri`, and `scope` parameters. 3. Users authorize
      the app and are redirected back to your `redirect_uri` with a code. 4. Exchange
      the code for an access token and refresh token by making a POST request to Xero's
      token endpoint, including your `client_id` and `client_secret` (for non-PKCE
      apps) in the Authorization header. 5. Use the refresh token to obtain new access
      tokens and refresh tokens when they expire by sending a POST request to the
      token endpoint with the `refresh_token` grant type. 6. To make API calls, you
      also need a Tenant ID, which can be retrieved by calling the connections endpoint
      after authentication.
  user_management_api_authentication_mechanisms:
    reference: hallucinated link doublecheck content
    value: OAuth 2.0 - Xero's API uses OAuth 2.0 for authentication, with grant types
      including Authorization code flow (for web apps), Proof Key for Code Exchange
      (PKCE) flow (for mobile and desktop apps), and Client credentials flow (premium
      integration). API requests use an access token as part of the Authorization
      header. Access tokens are JSON Web Tokens (JWT) valid for up to 30 minutes and
      can be refreshed using a refresh token (valid for up to 60 days) obtained with
      the `offline_access` scope.
  user_management_api_licensing_level:
    reference: hallucinated link doublecheck content
    value: uncertain - The API permissions are linked to user roles (Standard or Adviser
      level) rather than specific license levels for the API itself.
  user_management_api_support:
    reference: hallucinated link doublecheck content
    value: yes - Xero provides an API that acts on behalf of a user, allowing access
      to Xero data. The API requires a valid access token and authorized tenant ID
      with each request. There are methods to manage users and their permissions within
      the Xero UI.

  event_logs:
    api_call:
      reference: https://developer.xero.com/partner/security-standard-for-xero-api-consumers
      value: Xero requires audit logging functionality for API consumers, including
        both application-level (access logs) and event-based actions. These logs should
        include the date and time of the event, relevant user or process, event description,
        success or failure, event source, and ICT equipment location and identification.
        [2] The Accounting API provides access to 'History and Notes' for various
        document types (e.g., invoices, contacts, payments), which record changes,
        the UTC date of the record, the user responsible, and details of the change.
        API calls are logged, with 'System Generated' as the user for API-triggered
        changes. [16] For OAuth 2.0 apps, an API History (log) is available in the
        Developer Portal under 'MyApps' > 'History Tab'. [11]
    configuration_change:
      reference: https://central.xero.com/s/article/View-a-history-and-notes-summary-for-transactions-and-user-activity
      value: Xero logs changes made to transactions and payments, including the user,
        time, and date of the action. This 'History' is available for various document
        types like invoices, bank transactions, and contacts. [12], [16] There is
        also discussion among users regarding the need for a comprehensive audit trail
        report to track 'who made changes to what, and when', especially for deleted
        items. [5], [7]
    data_export:
      reference: hallucinated link doublecheck content
      value: Uncertain. While Xero integrates with various business intelligence and
        analytics tools for reporting and data manipulation, explicit security logging
        for data export actions from Xero itself was not found in the search results.

      reference: https://www.xero.com/us/security/
      value: Uncertain. While Xero has security standards for API consumers and a
        vulnerability disclosure program, detailed information on security logs specifically
        for changes to security policies within the Xero application was not found.
        [2], [4], [9], [25], [26], [39]
    user_account_creation:
      reference: hallucinated link doublecheck content
      value: Uncertain. While Xero has user management features, specific details
        about security logs for the creation of B2B administrative users were not
        explicitly found in the search results. [12]
    user_login:
      reference: https://central.xero.com/s/article/Security-in-Xero
      value: Xero allows users to view their 10 most recent login attempts, including
        date, time, country, and IP address. This can be found on the dashboard by
        clicking the link showing the last login time. If a VPN or proxy service is
        used, the login history will show the IP address and location where the connection
        originates. [6]
  event_logs_licensing_level:
    reference: https://www.xero.com/us/security/
    value: Uncertain. The search results do not specify any particular licensing level
      required to access security audit logs. Xero provides security assurance reports
      (ISO 27001 certificate or SOC 2 report) to users with a Xero login, or upon
      request if without a login. [4], [25], [26]

  invalidate_sessions_api:
    reference: https://developer.xero.com/documentation/oauth2/overview/revoking-tokens
    value: It is possible to revoke a user's refresh token, which removes all their
      connections to an application. This action will prevent further API calls from
      that application.
  known_automation_tools:
  - reference: https://www.pagerduty.com/customer/xero/
    value: Xero's internal Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) team uses a homegrown
      chatbot named "Multivac" integrated with Slack and leveraging PagerDuty's API
      to automate incident management activities. Multivac helps with on-call schedule
      management, notifying team members, creating Slack channels for incidents, and
      providing status updates. [1, 5, 16]
  - reference: https://zapier.com/apps/xero/integrations
    value: Zapier can be used to connect Xero with other business-critical tools for
      automation, such as creating invoices automatically, keeping teams informed,
      creating spreadsheet backups of payments and invoices, and pushing information
      to Xero using webhooks. [42]
  - reference: https://n8n.io/integrations/xero/
    value: n8n, a workflow automation tool, has a built-in integration for Xero, allowing
      for incident response automation. [17]

    value: Pipedream allows developers to build custom workflows using the Xero Accounting
      API for automation, such as invoicing, bank reconciliation, bill payments, and
      reporting. It securely stores and automatically refreshes OAuth tokens. [35]
  revoke_api_key_api:
    reference: https://developer.xero.com/documentation/oauth2/overview/revoking-tokens
    value: Xero uses OAuth 2.0 for API authentication, not traditional API keys. It
      is possible to revoke a user's refresh token which removes all their connections
      to an application. [9, 26] Previously, an archived forum post from 2019 indicated
      that revoking access via API was not possible and users had to disconnect manually
      through the UI, but current documentation (2025) specifies a revocation endpoint
      for OAuth 2.0 refresh tokens. [9, 22]
  session_timeout_configuration:
    reference: hallucinated link doublecheck content
    value: Xero offers a "Remember me for 30 days" optional setting for two-step authentication,
      meaning users won't need to perform the second authentication step on that device
      for 30 days. This implies a session persistence setting, but no explicit configurable
      session timeout values (e.g., minimum values) were found.
  suspend_user_api:
    reference: https://developer.xero.com/documentation/api/accounting/users
    value: Uncertain. There is no direct API endpoint found for suspending a user.
      The "Users" API allows retrieval of user details including their role, but no
      methods for modifying user status were explicitly found in the search results.
  user_status_api:
    reference: https://developer.xero.com/documentation/api/accounting/users
    value: The Xero Accounting API includes a "Users" endpoint that allows retrieval
      of user details, including "OrganisationRole" which indicates the user's role
      (e.g., ADMIN). It also returns "IsSubscriber" to indicate if a user is the subscriber.
      However, it does not explicitly provide a "status" like active or suspended.
  user_toggle_api:
    reference: https://productideas.xero.com/forums/939198-for-small-businesses/suggestions/46001287-user-roles-permissions-ability-to-suspend-user
    value: Uncertain. No direct API was found to toggle user status (e.g., active
      to suspended/disabled and vice versa) or to confirm if such a toggle would disable
      active sessions. While session invalidation is possible through token revocation,
      a user status toggle via API is not explicitly documented.
