user_management:
  sso_support:
    value: Xero primarily functions as an Identity Provider (IdP) using OpenID Connect,
      allowing users to log into third-party applications with their Xero credentials.
      It does not offer native support for SAML or OIDC to act as a Service Provider
      for logging into the Xero platform itself. Third-party identity solutions can
      provide SSO for Xero, but this is not a native feature.
    reference: https://developer.xero.com/documentation/oauth2/sign-in-with-xero
  sso_licensing_level_requirement:
    value: The ability to use "Sign in with Xero" (Xero as an IdP) is available to
      all users with a Xero account and is not tied to a specific pricing plan. Third-party
      SSO solutions will have their own separate licensing costs.

  scim_support:
    value: 'no'
    reference: https://www.okta.com/integrations/xero-by-aquera/
  scim_licensing_level_requirement:
    value: SCIM provisioning is not a native feature. It can be achieved through third-party
      connectors like 'Xero by Aquera', which is available on the Okta marketplace.
      The licensing requirement would be based on the pricing of the third-party
      provider (e.g., Aquera), not on the Xero subscription plan.

  scim_authentication_mechanisms:
    value: n/a
    reference: ''
  scim_authentication_acquisition_steps: 'SCIM is not natively supported by Xero. To
    use SCIM, you must procure a third-party service like Aquera. The steps would
    be:

    1. Purchase a subscription to the third-party SCIM provider (e.g., Aquera).

    2. Follow the provider''s documentation to configure the connection to your Identity
    Provider (e.g., Okta).

    3. The third-party tool will then use Xero''s OAuth 2.0 API for authentication.
    You will need to create a Xero API app in the Xero Developer Centre.

    4. In the Xero Developer Centre, go to "My Apps" and create a new app.

    5. Obtain the Client ID and Client Secret from your new Xero app.

    6. Provide these credentials to the third-party SCIM tool for it to authenticate
    with the Xero API.'
  user_management_api_support:
    value: 'no'
    reference: https://developer.xero.com/documentation/api/accounting/users/
  user_management_api_licensing_level:
    value: The Xero Accounting API's 'Users' endpoint is available on all Xero plans,
      but it is read-only (GET method only). For more stable machine-to-machine connections,
      a "Custom Connection" is available as a paid add-on (approx. $5-10 USD/month)
      which uses the client_credentials grant type, but this does not add user management
      capabilities.
    reference: https://developer.xero.com/documentation/guides/oauth2/custom-connections/
  user_management_api_authentication_mechanisms:
    value: Authentication token
    reference: https://developer.xero.com/documentation/oauth2/auth-flow/
  user_management_api_authentication_acquisition_steps: 'The Xero API for retrieving
    user data uses OAuth 2.0. User creation, update, and deletion are not supported
    via the API. To get authentication credentials for read-only access:

    1. Create a free user account on the Xero Developer Center (developer.xero.com).

    2. Navigate to the "My Apps" section.

    3. Click the "New App" button.

    4. Fill in your application''s details, including the App Name, Company URL,
    and at least one OAuth 2.0 redirect URI (e.g., http://localhost:3000/callback
    for development).

    5. Agree to the terms and conditions and click "Create app".

    6. On the app details screen, your "Client ID" will be visible.

    7. Click "Generate a secret" to create a "Client Secret". Copy this value immediately
    as it will only be shown once.

    8. These credentials are used in the OAuth 2.0 authorization flow to obtain an
    access token.'
