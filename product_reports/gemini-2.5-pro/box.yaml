      3. Configure a Redirect URI, which is where Box.com redirects the browser after
      the user logs in and authorizes the application.

      4. Configure Application Scopes to define the app''s permissions.

      5. The SDKs provide built-in support for OAuth 2.0, guiding through obtaining
      an authorization code, handling the OAuth callback, and exchanging the code
      for an access token.


      **JSON Web Tokens (JWT)**:

      1. JWT is primarily used for server-to-server authentication for Platform Apps
      and involves administrator approval, after which a service account is assigned
      for API calls.

      2. The Box SDKs can be initialized with JWT authentication using the app''s
      client ID, secret, and signing keys.


      **Developer Tokens (for development/testing)**:

      1. Navigate to the Box Developer Console and select the application.

      2. Go to the "Configuration" tab.

      3. Under "Developer Token," select "Generate Developer Token."

  event_logs:
    api_call:
      reference: https://medium.com/box-developer-blog/box-enterprise-events-api-python-5d912f379099
      value: Box offers an Enterprise Event Stream API that allows customers to subscribe
        to Box events in near real-time. This API provides an event stream related
        to any user or content within an enterprise Box instance. The `admin_logs`
        stream type allows for historical queries up to one year, while `admin_logs_streaming`
        provides near real-time events. Box API SDKs for Java and Node.js include
        classes for handling user and enterprise event streams, which utilize long-polling
        for real-time events.
    configuration_change:
      reference: https://support.box.com/hc/en-us/articles/4415103894803-Security-Logs-Report
      value: Security Logs in Box track changes made to settings in the Admin Console.
        These reports can include actions such as enabling or disabling custom shared
        link URLs. The `configuration_change` event type is not explicitly listed,
        but the security logs report covers admin setting changes. The Admin Logs
        API can be used to build custom security and compliance monitoring solutions
        by monitoring admin activities and account changes.
    data_export:
      reference: https://docs.netskope.com/en/box-audit-events/
      value: Box logs `download` events. Box Shield can detect anomalous content download
        behavior and provide alerts. Varonis also offers detection for when a user
        shares sensitive data publicly. While direct 'data export' as a specific event
        type beyond downloads isn't explicitly detailed, data export actions would
        typically involve downloads or sharing, which are logged.
    role_assignment:
      reference: https://docs.netskope.com/en/box-audit-events/
      value: Box logs `collaboration_role_change` events, which indicate changes to
        user roles. Additionally, events like `group_add_user`, `group_creation`,
        `group_deletion`, `group_edited`, and `group_remove_user` are available, which
        are related to group management and indirectly to role assignments. The API
        for enterprise events also provides access to information about user management.
    security_policy_change:
      reference: https://support.box.com/hc/en-us/articles/9134358908435-Security-Logs-reporting-expanded-to-include-more-admin-changes-to-Apps-area-settings
      value: Box Governance allows organizations to manage content lifecycle, including
        creating and editing security policies. While specific event types for 'security
        policy change' are not individually detailed in the provided audit event lists,
        Box's security logs track changes made to settings in the Admin Console, which
        would encompass security policy modifications. Box Shield helps define and
        manage security classification labels and enforce classification-based access
        controls, implying logging of changes to these policies.
    user_account_creation:
      reference: https://docs.netskope.com/en/box-audit-events/
      value: Box logs `new_user` and `delete_user` events, indicating user account
        creation and deletion. The `edit_user` event is also logged. SIEM integrations
        can pull authentication and administrative activity, including new account
        created and account deleted.
    user_login:
      reference: https://docs.netskope.com/en/box-audit-events/
      value: Box provides logs for user login activity, including successful and failed
        logins. These events can be pulled via the Box Events API. [6, 10, 13] The
        `login` and `failed_login` event types are available. For events related to
        user interactions with files and folders, the 'Updates' page within Box provides
        logs for actions such as downloads, uploads, comments, and previews.
  event_logs_licensing_level:
    reference: hallucinated link doublecheck content
    value: Access to the enterprise event streams (admin_logs and admin_logs_streaming)
      is limited to users with admin permissions to 'Run new reports and access existing
      reports'. A full admin privilege, not co-admin, is required to read events from
      the entire enterprise account when using Panther's integration. Box Governance
      is an add-on that enables setting retention policies, legal holds, and security
      classifications. Box Shield is an advanced security offering for classification-based
      security controls and threat detection. [14, 16, 18] It is implied that these
      advanced security features, including comprehensive logging and alerting, are
      part of higher-tier enterprise or add-on licenses.

        Enterprise events are accessible for one year via the API and seven years
        via exported reports in the Box Admin Console. SIEM integrations typically
        utilize the Box API to pull activity logs. Box also provides Security Logs
        reports within the Admin Console that can be run for a defined time period
        and filtered by action type.

  invalidate_sessions_api:
    reference: https://support.box.com/hc/en-us/articles/6024817730963-Box-is-adding-User-Session-Termination-to-our-Box-API
    value: Box has added new API functionality to allow Box Admins to terminate user
      sessions more easily and at scale. This API capability can log out a user or
      a group from all their active Box sessions, including sessions for web, desktop,
      and mobile. [20]
  known_automation_tools:
  - reference: https://sourceforge.net/software/security-orchestration-automation-and-response-soar/integrates-with-box/
    value: Rapid7 InsightConnect is a Security Orchestration, Automation and Response
      (SOAR) solution that integrates with Box. It helps accelerate time-intensive,
      manual incident response and vulnerability management processes with over 300
      plugins and customizable workflows. [9]
  - reference: https://sourceforge.net/software/security-orchestration-automation-and-response-soar/integrates-with-box/
    value: Blink Ops, with its Blink platform, is another SOAR solution that integrates
      with Box. It offers automated flows to reduce noise and false positives in alerts
      and scans for attacks. [9]
  - reference: https://slashdot.org/software/security-orchestration-automation-and-response-soar/for-box/
    value: Mindflow provides an extensive integration library for enterprise automation,
      including Box, and allows for creating AI-generated workflows. [28]
  - reference: https://xsoar.pan.dev/docs/reference/integrations/box-v2
    value: Cortex XSOAR has an integration with Box v2. This integration manages Box
      users and uses JWT for authentication. It allows for configuring the Box application
      to interface with XSOAR, including generating public/private keypairs and enabling
      actions as users. [21]
  revoke_api_key_api:
    reference: https://developer.box.com/reference/post-oauth2-revoke/
    value: Uncertain. While Box Platform supports various authentication methods like
      OAuth 2.0, JSON Web Token (JWT), Client Credentials, and App Token authentication,
      and the Box API reference details authorization, there is no explicit API endpoint
      found to programmatically revoke individual API keys or personal tokens. OAuth
      2.0 authentication involves redirect URIs and refresh tokens, but a direct 'revoke'
      API for keys was not found. [1, 12]
  session_timeout_configuration:
    reference: https://support.box.com/hc/en-us/articles/360043697394-Our-Approach-to-Incident-Response-and-Communications
    value: Box allows enterprise customers to modify session duration by going to
      Enterprise Settings -> Security and scrolling down to the 'Session Duration
      for All Users' section. The default web session timeout was changed from 2 days
      to 14 days in 2021. [2, 15]
  suspend_user_api:
    reference: https://master--boxdev.netlify.app/reference/
    value: Uncertain. While Box offers user management capabilities, specific API
      documentation for 'suspending' a user to immediately revoke access (distinct
      from merely changing their status to inactive which may or may not immediately
      terminate sessions) was not explicitly found. The `Users` API allows for updating
      user information, which might include status, but the direct impact on active
      sessions is not detailed as a suspend API function. [6]
  user_status_api:
    reference: https://master--boxdev.netlify.app/reference/
    value: Uncertain. The Box API Reference provides endpoints for managing users,
      which would likely include retrieving user information. However, specific details
      on an API endpoint that explicitly provides a 'status' (active vs. suspended/disabled/non-existent)
      that can be programmatically queried for incident response purposes were not
      found. User management functions typically allow retrieving user details, which
      may include status information. [6]
  user_toggle_api:
    reference: https://support.box.com/hc/en-us/articles/6024817730963-Box-is-adding-User-Session-Termination-to-our-Box-API
    value: Uncertain. While Box provides an API to terminate user sessions, and allows
      for managing users, explicit documentation on an API to toggle user status (active/suspended/disabled)
      with a clear indication of its immediate effect on active sessions was not found.
      The session termination API directly addresses active sessions. [20]
