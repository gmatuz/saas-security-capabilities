  rbac_api_assignment:
    reference: https://mailchimp.com/help/manage-user-levels-in-your-account/
    value: Uncertain. While user levels can be changed manually through the Mailchimp
      interface by an Owner or Admin, direct API capabilities for assigning or changing
      these roles were not explicitly found in the provided search results. SCIM provisioning
      with Ping Identity mentions "outbound user provisioning, deprovisioning and
      updates" and "set user roles" by creating groups and assigning roles to them,
      which implies some level of API-driven RBAC assignment. Okta also states "Group
      Push" for Mailchimp, where groups can be managed in Okta and changes reflected
      in the application.
  rbac_support:
    reference: https://mailchimp.com/help/manage-user-levels-in-your-account/
    value: yes - Mailchimp supports role-based access control with predefined user
      levels (Owner, Admin, Manager, Author, Viewer), each having different permissions.
  scim_authentication_acquisition_steps:
    reference: https://vertexaisearch.cloud.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQEdAv7AVBgoCjMcSIZcSPb_hDvEhURh2beDgqOG45QFLOkOpUhZ4KJKIjN2rJ-_LCYEVtRSRkIq5KH3bjzE2BsfVJbEpj4wLanfyONuD3V85dj76tEuPiX6Jyr0Iv9FGsXZDDtjLNdTaVMFEpNi_No-l6na1C0jLfTPL4fqiA==
    value: To acquire API Key for Mailchimp provisioning with miniOrange, you need
      data center from Mailchimp URL, Audience list ID, and the API key from your
      Mailchimp account. For general Mailchimp API, an API key can be created by logging
      into Mailchimp, navigating to Account settings, then Extras, and finally API
      keys to generate a new key.
  scim_authentication_mechanisms:
    reference: https://www.miniorange.com/iam/integrations/mailchimp-provisioning
    value: API Key (for provisioning with miniOrange). For general Mailchimp API,
      OAuth and API Key authentication are supported, with OAuth recommended for customer-facing
      integrations. SCIM endpoints provided by Unified.to are SCIM-compliant, implying
      standard SCIM authentication.
  scim_licensing_level_requirement:
    reference: https://community.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-entra-azure-ad-identity/azure-ad-premium-license-requirement-for-scim/m-p/761923
    value: Uncertain. While SCIM provisioning is available through third-party integrations,
      specific Mailchimp documentation linking SCIM support to particular license
      levels was not found. Ping Identity mentions SCIM provisioning for "Mailchimp
      Business".
  scim_support:
    reference: https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQH42kCLiQh__-EsbrIhlcmG1fLmVrAheBlfLHgKC0EO_yiMDkgQEZyxXNnsFD0lVz8_-2LRnECr9QMSH1idsmLNYuhPMESTaDOxbQzWf9FKds-g9Mc0Rwii8Di6oA_hnyvgC8WDczyuensnAidq6t5XBZL49LbHHPaPJBXleJpuEVJg4kRIHw8wsKYnIgX8yutxOsd9LRxHY3Fb28qOLKyHrTTRFTQAHMjG
    value: yes - SCIM 2.0 is supported through integrations with identity providers
      like Ping Identity and Okta. Unified.to also provides SCIM-compliant endpoints
      for Mailchimp.

  - archived:
      reference: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kY6f0h63fWw
      value: No, archived contacts do not count towards seat costs in Mailchimp. [6,
        12]
    license_level: All plans
    suspended_disabled:
      reference: https://mailchimp.com/help/manage-user-levels-in-your-account/
      value: Uncertain. Mailchimp's pricing plans determine the number of additional
        user seats available. It is not explicitly stated whether suspended/disabled
        users still count towards seat costs in the provided information.
  sso_license_level_requirement:
    reference: https://capsulecrm.com/blog/8-top-mailchimp-integrations-for-effective-email-marketing/
    value: Uncertain. While third-party integrations for SSO are available across
      various plans, specific Mailchimp documentation linking SSO to particular license
      levels was not found. Some third-party integrations mention being available
      for all plans or free plans.
  sso_support:
    reference: https://www.miniorange.com/iam/integrations/mailchimp-single-sign-on-sso
    value: yes - SAML 2.0, OAuth, OpenID, and potentially browser extension based
      SSO (miniOrange). Integrations with major IDPs like Microsoft Entra ID (Azure
      AD), Okta, and OneLogin are available.
  user_management_api_authentication_acquisition_steps:
    reference: https://mailchimp.com/help/about-api-keys/
    value: An API Key can be created by logging into your Mailchimp account, clicking
      your profile icon, selecting "Account & billing," then "Extras," and finally
      "API keys" to generate a new key.
  user_management_api_authentication_mechanisms:
    reference: https://www.vessel.dev/blog/how-to-build-a-mailchimp-integration
    value: OAuth and API Key. OAuth is recommended for customer-facing integrations.
  user_management_api_licensing_level:
    reference: https://mailchimp.com/developer/
    value: Uncertain. The Mailchimp Marketing API is generally available, but specific
      licensing requirements for its various functionalities related to user management
      (beyond audience contact management) are not explicitly detailed in the provided
      search results.
  user_management_api_support:
    reference: https://www.vessel.dev/blog/how-to-build-a-mailchimp-integration
    value: yes - Mailchimp provides a Marketing API that allows for reading and writing
      data, including subscriber information (contacts) and campaign data. [21, 26,
      37] This API can be used to add, update, and manage contacts within audiences.

  event_logs:
    api_call:
      reference: https://mailchimp.com/developer/marketing/guides/fundamentals/
      value: The Mailchimp Marketing API provides programmatic access for syncing
        email activity and campaign analytics. Extensions can make requests to the
        Mailchimp API, and these requests can be seen in edge logs. The API has a
        limit of 10 simultaneous connections per user and a 120-second timeout, with
        429 errors for exceeding limits, suggesting internal logging for throttling.
        However, a comprehensive security log schema for all API calls by users to
        the business and administrative APIs, including details like source IP and
        specific API endpoint accessed for SIEM integration, is uncertain from available
        documentation.
    configuration_change:
      reference: https://mailchimp.com/help/best-practices-for-account-security/
      value: Certain changes to a Mailchimp account, such as password modifications,
        trigger email notifications to the account owner. However, detailed security
        audit logs specifically for all types of configuration changes within the
        Mailchimp platform, with a schema suitable for SIEM integration, are not explicitly
        described in the publicly available documentation.
    data_export:
      reference: hallucinated link doublecheck content
      value: Mailchimp allows exporting account data (audiences, templates, marketing
        emails, SMS data) as a ZIP file containing CSVs through the UI, with an email
        notification upon completion. The Mailchimp Transactional API also supports
        exporting activity history to a ZIP archive. Past security incidents have
        involved unauthorized actors exporting audience data. While export functionality
        exists and triggers internal notifications, a specific security log schema
        detailing data export actions suitable for SIEM integration is uncertain.
    role_assignment:
      reference: hallucinated link doublecheck content
      value: Mailchimp allows for tiered levels of access within accounts (e.g., Owner,
        Admin, Manager, Editor, Author). Users with an 'Admin' role can see contact
        data, billing information, and can export data. There is advice to regularly
        check and revoke access for unfamiliar users or adjust their roles for data
        protection. However, explicit security audit logs detailing specific role
        assignment or modification events with a defined schema for SIEM integration
        are not clearly documented.
    security_policy_change:
      reference: https://mailchimp.com/about/security/
      value: Mailchimp undergoes regular external and internal security penetration
        tests and maintains SOC 2 and ISO 27001 certifications which cover security
        controls and information security management systems. While these certifications
        imply internal processes for managing security policies, explicit customer-facing
        audit logs for security policy changes within the Mailchimp product itself
        are not detailed in the available documentation.
    user_account_creation:
      reference: https://getbrave.io/share-mailchimp-login-details/
      value: Mailchimp allows for establishing tiered levels of access for users within
        an account. It is recommended to regularly review and manage user access.
        However, specific security audit logs detailing the creation, modification,
        or deletion of B2B administrative user accounts, including a schema for SIEM
        integration, are not explicitly documented.
    user_login:
      reference: https://mailchimp.com/about/security/
      value: Mailchimp monitors and automatically suspends accounts for signs of irregular
        or suspicious login activity. Users can enable email or SMS notifications
        for key activity, including password changes. Login pages and Mailchimp API
        logins have brute force protection. Security questions are used for logins
        from unknown IP addresses or identity verification. However, a detailed security
        log schema for successful and failed user logins, suitable for direct SIEM
        integration, is not explicitly available in public documentation.
  event_logs_licensing_level:
    reference: https://mailtrap.io/pricing/
    value: The documentation does not explicitly state that a specific licensing level
      is required for accessing general security audit logs. However, the retention
      period for custom event data used for segmentation varies by plan type (e.g.,
      30 days for Free/Essentials, 3 months for Standard, 18 months for Premium),
      suggesting that access to historical activity data might be dependent on the
      Mailchimp plan.
  ingestion_methods:
  - reference: https://mailchimp.com/developer/marketing/guides/fundamentals/
    value: Mailchimp provides a Marketing API (version 3.0) and a single-purpose Export
      API (version 1.0) for programmatic access to data.
  - reference: https://mailchimp.com/help/about-webhooks/
    value: Webhooks are available to send real-time updates about audience changes
      (subscribes, unsubscribes, profile updates, email changes) and campaign sending
      to a specified URL via HTTP POST requests.
  log_export_options:
    tools_connectors:
      reference: https://mailchimp.com/developer/marketing/guides/fundamentals/
      value: Mailchimp offers API access (Marketing API and Export API) for programmatic
        data retrieval. It also supports webhooks for real-time event notifications.
        Users can manually export various account data as ZIP files containing CSVs
        through the Mailchimp interface. Third-party connectors like n8n.io, Pipedream,
        Coupler.io, and Coefficient facilitate data extraction and integration with
        other platforms, including SIEMs.

  invalidate_sessions_api:
    reference: https://www.phishprotection.com/phishing-awareness/mailchimp-security-incident-impact-digitaloceans-customers
    value: Uncertain. There is no explicit documentation of an API to programmatically
      invalidate all or specific sessions for a Mailchimp user. The capability to
      suspend accounts due to suspicious activity has been mentioned in incident responses,
      which might imply session termination.
  known_automation_tools:
  - reference: https://rollout.com/integration-guides/mailchimp/api-essentials
    value: Mailchimp offers a RESTful API (Marketing API and Transactional API) that
      allows programmatic access to its features for automating tasks, retrieving

    value: Webhooks are available for both the Mailchimp Transactional API and Marketing
      API, allowing real-time notifications for events like subscribes, unsubscribes,
      and campaign sending.
  - reference: https://docs.n8n.io/
    value: n8n, a workflow automation tool, lists Mailchimp as one of its built-in
      nodes for integrations.
  revoke_api_key_api:
    reference: https://mailchimp.com/help/about-api-keys/
    value: It is possible to manually revoke an API key from the Mailchimp account
      profile. This action cannot be undone, and a new key must be generated. If a
      user's access to a Mailchimp account is revoked, any API keys generated by that
      user are also removed.
  session_timeout_configuration:
    reference: hallucinated link doublecheck content
    value: Uncertain. While there are recommendations for users to implement multi-factor
      authentication for security, and discussions around password reliance, explicit
      documentation regarding session timeout configuration values (including minimums)
      for Mailchimp user sessions was not found.
  suspend_user_api:
    reference: https://www.phishprotection.com/phishing-awareness/mailchimp-security-incident-impact-digitaloceans-customers
    value: Uncertain. Mailchimp has temporarily suspended accounts where suspicious
      activity was detected during past security incidents, but there is no explicit
      mention of a public API for programmatic user suspension.
  user_status_api:
    reference: https://medium.com/fiatinsight/using-the-mailchimp-api-to-check-a-wordpress-users-subscription-status-4db55649c648
    value: The Mailchimp API allows checking the status of members within a list (audience).
      You can make a GET request to `/lists/{list_id}/members` and use the `status`
      query string parameter (e.g., "pending" or "subscribed") to retrieve member
      statuses.
  user_toggle_api:
    reference: https://www.phishprotection.com/phishing-awareness/mailchimp-security-incident-impact-digitaloceans-customers
    value: Uncertain. While Mailchimp can temporarily suspend accounts, and users
      have statuses like "subscribed", "unsubscribed", "non-subscribed", and "cleaned",
      there is no direct API documentation found that explicitly describes toggling
      a user's active/suspended/disabled status.
