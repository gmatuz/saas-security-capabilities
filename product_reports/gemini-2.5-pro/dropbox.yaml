    reference: https://www.dropboxforum.com/discussions/101000014/how-to-revoke-an-access-token-other-answers-suggest-security-page-but-doesnt-app/218563
    value: The Dropbox API provides the `/2/auth/token/revoke` endpoint to revoke
      an individual access token used to authenticate the call. Users can also revoke
      all access tokens for an app via their account security page by clicking the
      'x' next to the app's row. Team admins can unlink apps from their teams using
      the Team apps page. Additionally, in response to a security breach, Dropbox
      rotated all compromised API keys and OAuth tokens. Refresh tokens can also be
      revoked on demand by the app or user.
  session_timeout_configuration:
    reference: https://www.dropboxforum.com/discussions/101000014/api-session-expiry/129838
    value: Uncertain. While Dropbox uses short-lived access tokens and longer-lived
      refresh tokens, and allows for token revocation, specific configurable session
      timeout values (e.g., minimum durations) were not explicitly found in the search
      results.
  suspend_user_api:
    reference: https://www.dropboxforum.com/discussions/101000014/can-we-delete-suspend-user-from-dropbox-using-net-api/412955
    value: Dropbox provides an API endpoint `/team/members/suspend` to programmatically
      suspend a member from a team. This action requires 'Team member management'
      permission. When a user is suspended, their access tokens stop working, and
      any further API calls will result in a 401 Unauthorized error with a 'user_suspended'
      message. Suspended users continue to occupy a user license and can be reinstated
      using `/team/members/unsuspend`. The .NET SDK also offers `MembersSuspendAsync`
      for this purpose.
  user_status_api:
    reference: https://www.educative.io/courses/dropbox-api-python/get-user-information
    value: 'The Dropbox API can provide information about user status. There are five
      possible statuses in a user lifecycle in a Dropbox team: Invited, Active, Suspended,
      and Deleted. The `/team/members/get_info` endpoint (or similar, not explicitly
      found for user status but for team member info) can be used to retrieve member
      information, including their status. Specific API calls may only work on users
      with certain statuses. The `include_removed` parameter can return members in
      all states.'
  user_toggle_api:
    reference: https://www.dropboxforum.com/discussions/101000014/can-we-delete-suspend-user-from-dropbox-using-net-api/412955
    value: The `/team/members/suspend` API allows for suspending users, which disables
      their active sessions. Users can also be reinstated (unsuspended) using `/team/members/unsuspend`.
      This acts as a toggle for user status that affects session validity.
