  rbac_api_assignment:
    reference: hallucinated link doublecheck content
    value: uncertain - While SCIM provisioning is available for users and groups via
      Atlassian Guard, and the Trello REST API can invite users, there is no explicit
      mention or detailed documentation found about directly assigning Trello-specific
      roles (Normal, Admin, Observer) or managing board-level permissions through
      an API. RBAC is managed through the Trello interface for Workspace and board
      settings. [7, 8, 21, 22]
  rbac_support:
    reference: https://trello.com/guide/permissions-controls
    value: 'yes - Trello supports different roles: Normal (view and edit cards, some
      board permissions), Admin (view and edit cards, remove members, change all board
      settings), and Observer (access content, comment, emoji react, but cannot edit
      cards - available in Premium). Workspace admins also have additional controls.
      [7, 21, 22, 25]'

    value: Enterprise token. [36]
  scim_licensing_level_requirement:
    reference: https://jira.atlassian.com/browse/ACCESS-814
    value: Trello Enterprise user management and SCIM group provisioning is available
      to Trello Enterprise customers. Atlassian Guard Standard (formerly Atlassian
      Access) enables SCIM IdP sync. [42]
  scim_support:
    reference: https://support.atlassian.com/trello/docs/configuring-sso-for-your-enterprise/
    value: yes - SCIM V2 is supported for user and group provisioning, but Trello's
      SCIM API is in the process of being retired. The recommended approach is to
      provision Atlassian accounts using Atlassian SCIM API and then invite users
      to Trello Workspaces. [8, 14, 36, 37]

    value: Atlassian Guard (formerly Atlassian Access) is a separate subscription
      that starts at $4/month/user and enables SSO across all Atlassian products,
      including Trello. SSO can be configured without Trello Enterprise, but if you
      subscribe to Trello Enterprise, you need to be an admin to complete the guide.
      [1, 3, 8]
  sso_support:
    reference: https://support.atlassian.com/trello/docs/configuring-sso-for-your-enterprise/
    value: yes - SAML through Atlassian Access. Supports IdP-initiated and SP-initiated
      SSO. [8, 11, 12, 15]
  user_management_api_authentication_acquisition_steps:
    reference: https://support.atlassian.com/trello/docs/configuring-sso-for-your-enterprise/
    value: Uncertain. The documentation does not provide step-by-step user guides
      to acquire user management API credentials for Trello's REST API, aside from
      the SCIM token acquisition. [8, 36]
  user_management_api_authentication_mechanisms:
    reference: https://support.atlassian.com/trello/docs/configuring-sso-for-your-enterprise/
    value: Uncertain. The documentation refers to the Trello REST API for inviting
      users, but does not specify the authentication mechanisms for general user management
      outside of SCIM. [8]
  user_management_api_licensing_level:
    reference: https://support.atlassian.com/trello/docs/inviting-people-to-a-workspace/
    value: Uncertain. While the Trello REST API is mentioned for inviting users, specific
      licensing requirements for its user management functionalities are not explicitly
      detailed in the search results. Access to the API generally depends on the developer
      API documentation, but user management specific features could be tied to paid
      plans. However, general user invitations can be done in bulk with email addresses
      or Trello usernames, and for Premium subscribers, linking a Google Apps account
      allows adding the entire company. [6]
  user_management_api_support:
    reference: https://support.atlassian.com/trello/docs/configuring-sso-for-your-enterprise/
    value: yes - Users can be invited to Workspaces through the Trello REST API. [8]

    api_call:
      reference: https://trello.com/security
      value: All Trello API calls are kept for internal purposes for at least 45 days,
        without sensitive information, and are available only to authorized employees
        for monitoring. [1, 5] The Trello REST API allows developers to interact with
        Trello's platform to create, read, update, and delete data. [8] Previously,
        the Trello REST API allowed unauthenticated queries for public profile information
        using an email address, but this vulnerability was addressed in January 2024
        to require authentication for such requests. [14, 18] Authenticated users
        can still request publicly available information. [18] Webhooks are encouraged
        for real-time updates on Trello resources like boards, cards, and members,
        without frequent API calls. [8]

      value: The Enterprise Admin Dashboard allows administrators to view and manage
        permissions for Workspaces and boards within their Enterprise, and set default
        company-wide board visibility permissions. [7] The Audit Log captures Enterprise-wide
        permission settings. [3, 7] Trello Enterprise provides administrative controls
        and significant enhancements in security, including managing public boards
        and setting permissions easily from the administration panel. [15]
    user_account_creation:
      reference: https://www.atlassian.com/software/trello/enterprise
      value: The Enterprise Admin Dashboard's Audit Log includes membership changes.

        logs, which are retained for at least 45 days in Splunk for monitoring and
        analysis, and for 12 months in S3 CloudWatch buckets for retention. [1, 5]
        Trello Enterprise offers two-step verification (2SV) through Atlassian Guard
        for extra login security, and admins can enforce it for all employees. [19]
        Single Sign-On (SSO) can also be configured via Atlassian Guard Standard for
        Enterprise accounts. [3]
  event_logs_licensing_level:
    reference: https://www.atlassian.com/software/trello/enterprise
    value: Security logging capabilities, including the Enterprise Admin Dashboard
      with its audit log and advanced security features like SSO and 2SV, are part
      of Trello Enterprise. [3, 7, 15, 19] Enterprise admins have access to the Enterprise-wide
      management dashboard. [3, 7] Access to the Enterprise audit log for populating
      Google Sheets data requires an Enterprise admin token. [27]

  monitoring_products:
  - reference: https://trello.com/security
    value: Splunk is used internally by Trello for central collection and analysis
      of application logs. [1, 5] There's a Splunk add-on available for ingesting

    reference: https://support.atlassian.com/trello/docs/revoking-a-trello-token/
    value: Uncertain. For Trello Enterprise, administrators can delete mobile app
      session tokens, which will log the user out of Trello on mobile. However, there
      is no explicit mention or documentation of an API to programmatically invalidate
      all active sessions for a user (web and mobile) beyond revoking API tokens.

    reference: https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/trello/guides/rest-api/authorization/
    value: It is possible to programmatically revoke API tokens through the Trello
      API using a DELETE action on the `/1/tokens` resource. Users can also manually
      revoke individual tokens via their account settings page. Trello Enterprise
      admins have the ability to view and delete API tokens generated by managed members,
      including Power-Up and mobile session tokens, and can restrict managed members
      from creating new API tokens.
  session_timeout_configuration:
    reference: https://trello.com/fr/legal/security
    value: Uncertain. Trello's security documentation mentions SAML 2.0 SSO for Enterprise
      customers and that Trello will inherit login security settings from the Identity
      Provider (IdP) if SSO or OAuth is used. However, specific configurable session
      timeout values or minimums within Trello itself are not explicitly detailed
      in the provided search results. Repeated failed login attempts trigger a 30-second

      and boards, which limits their access to content, there is no direct API documentation
      found that specifically describes suspending a user account programmatically.
      The ability to remove members from a board and workspace is mentioned, but this
      is distinct from a full user suspension.
  user_status_api:
    reference: https://www.itpro.com/security/cyber-attacks/15-million-trello-users-have-been-exposed-in-a-data-breach-heres-what-you-need-to-know
    value: Uncertain. While there is an API to get information about the current authenticated
      user (e.g., `/1/members/me` or `/1/members/you`), and a recent data breach involved
      the scraping of user status information, there is no explicit documentation
      of an API to query the active/suspended/disabled status of a user account for
      incident response purposes. Trello Enterprise admins can manage user team memberships
      and access.
  user_toggle_api:
    reference: hallucinated link doublecheck content
    value: Uncertain. While users can be removed from Workspaces and boards, and Trello
      Enterprise admins can delete mobile app session tokens, explicit API functionality
      to toggle user status (active/suspended/disabled) and whether such a toggle
      automatically disables active sessions is not clearly documented in the provided
      search results. The Trello support documentation suggests removing users from
      workspaces and boards when they leave a company.
