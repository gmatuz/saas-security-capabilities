  sso_support:
    value:
      SAP S/4HANA supports multiple Single Sign-On (SSO) mechanisms. For web-based
      applications like SAP Fiori, it supports SAML 2.0, OAuth 2.0, Kerberos/SPNEGO,
      and X.509 certificates. For SAP GUI access, it uses Secure Network Communications
      (SNC). [1, 7] SAP's Identity Authentication Service (IAS) often acts as a central
      identity provider or as a proxy to corporate identity providers like Microsoft
      Entra ID (Azure AD), enabling SSO across SAP and non-SAP applications. [24,
      37]

  sso_licensing_level_requirement:
    value:
      While the core functionality for SSO is part of the SAP NetWeaver stack (the
      foundation of S/4HANA), integrating with specific identity providers like Microsoft
      Entra ID may require premium licenses on the IdP side (e.g., Azure Active Directory
      Premium). [28] There is no specific S/4HANA license mentioned as a requirement
      for SSO itself, but the overall landscape, such as using SAP Identity Authentication
      Service, would be subject to its own licensing or be included in a bundle. [24]

  scim_licensing_level_requirement:
    value:
      SCIM functionality is provided through the SAP Identity Provisioning Service
      (IPS), which is part of SAP Business Technology Platform (BTP). [5, 18] Access
      to IPS and its connectors is typically included in bundles with other SAP Cloud
      products like S/4HANA Cloud or available as a separate subscription on SAP BTP.

    reference: https://community.sap.com/t5/technology-blogs-by-members/sac-user-management-with-the-rest-api-python/ba-p/13509720
  scim_authentication_acquisition_steps: 'In SAP S/4HANA Cloud, the communication for
    SCIM is typically set up via a Communication Arrangement (like SAP_COM_0093 or
    SAP_COM_0193) which generates a technical communication user and credentials (like
    a password or certificate) for the integration. For on-premise, integration with
    SAP Identity Provisioning Service involves setting up a connector in IPS and providing
    the necessary connection details, including the credentials of a technical user
    in the S/4HANA system with the required permissions. The authentication from the
    provisioning tool (e.g., Azure AD) to the SAP Identity Provisioning Service uses
    OAuth 2.0 Client Credentials. [22, 42]'
  user_management_api_support:
    value: yes
    reference: https://api.sap.com/api/MANAGEBUSINESSUSERIN/overview
  user_management_api_licensing_level:
    value:
      Access to APIs in S/4HANA is generally tied to the user's license type and authorizations,
      not a separate API-specific license. [13] However, usage of the SAP Business
      Technology Platform (BTP) for building applications that consume these APIs
      would have its own licensing costs. [4]

    reference: https://help.sap.com/docs/sap-s-4hana-cloud/it-setup-guide/setting-up-product-structure-template-management-35q
  user_management_api_authentication_acquisition_steps: '1. Log into your SAP S/4HANA
    system.

    2. To enable OAuth 2.0 for API access, you need to configure an OAuth 2.0 client.
    This is done via the `OA2C_CONFIG` transaction. [17]

    3. In `OA2C_CONFIG`, you create a new client configuration. You will need to define
    a client profile and provide the OAuth 2.0 Client ID obtained from the service
    you are integrating with. [8, 17]

    4. You will also need to provide the Client Secret and the Authorization and Token
    endpoints from the OAuth provider. [8]

    5. The process typically involves creating a service key in the SAP BTP subaccount
    where the service is hosted, which contains the `clientid`, `clientsecret`, and
    `url` (for the token endpoint). [26]

    6. Once the OAuth 2.0 client is configured and saved, the system can use this
    configuration to obtain an access token to call the API on behalf of the user
    or system. [9]'

    value:
      Yes, role assignments can be managed via API. The SAP Cloud Identity Access
      Governance (IAG) provides services for role design and access requests which
      can be automated. [31, 46] For direct assignments in S/4HANA Cloud, the `MANAGEBUSINESSUSERIN`
      SOAP API allows for the assignment of business roles to a business user. [35]
      In the SAP BTP environment, there is also an Authorization Management API that
      can manage role assignments to users. [4]
