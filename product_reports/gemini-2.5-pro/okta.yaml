  invalidate_sessions_api:
    reference: https://support.okta.com/help/s/article/how-to-invalidate-an-individual-session-in-oie-with-api-calls?language=en_US
    value: Okta offers an API to invalidate user sessions. For Okta Identity Engine
      (OIE), this involves a DELETE request to `/api/v1/sessions/me` using the `idx`
      cookie. In Okta Classic Engine, the API call was `DELETE {url}/api/v1/sessions/{sid}`
      using the session ID (`sid`). It is also possible to revoke all active identity
      provider sessions for a user, which forces re-authentication and can optionally
      revoke OpenID Connect and OAuth refresh and access tokens. [2, 17, 26, 38]
  known_automation_tools:
  - reference: https://www.okta.com/products/workflows/
    value: Okta Workflows is a no-code identity automation platform that allows customers

      System Logs using the Okta System Log API to identify suspicious activity and
      power security investigations. [34]
  - reference: https://www.zscaler.com/resources/white-papers/privacy-security-guide.pdf
    value: Zscaler integrates with identity providers like Okta to manage access dynamically
      and connects with SIEM and SOAR solutions for streamlined investigations and
      automated responses. [44]
  revoke_api_key_api:
    reference: https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/api/users/
    value: Okta provides the capability to manage user OAuth 2.0 tokens through an
      API. While specific API endpoints for revoking "personal tokens" or "global
      keys" were not explicitly detailed in the search results, the general capability
      to manage OAuth 2.0 tokens issued by an authorization server for a particular
      user and client exists. [8] Some SOAR integrations, like CrowdStrike, mention
      "session revocations" and "password resets" as automated identity actions. [25]
      Okta also advised customers to revoke embedded session tokens to prevent misuse
      during security incidents. [42]
  session_timeout_configuration:
    reference: https://support.okta.com/help/s/question/0D50Z00008Gghw9SAB/okta-session-timeout?language=en_US
    value: Okta session timeout can be configured through Okta Sign-on Policies. Users
      can increase the session lifetime up to a maximum of 90 days. This setting can
      be found under Security > Authentication > Sign On > Add New Okta Sign-on Policy.
      There is also a "Maximum Okta global session idle time" which can be configured
      for automatic session expiration. While UI options for setting a "Maximum Session
      Time" were not always available in the past, it could be done via APIs using
      SignOn Policy APIs. In Okta Identity Engine (OIE), the global session lifetime
      setting is located in the Global Session Policy. [3, 5, 10, 11]
  suspend_user_api:
    reference: https://www.postman.com/api-evangelist/authentication/request/3pzv3c0/suspend-user
    value: Okta provides an API endpoint to suspend a user. This operation can only
      be performed on users with an "ACTIVE" status, changing their status to "SUSPENDED"
      upon completion. This functionality is available via the Okta API at `/api/v1/users/{userId}/lifecycle/suspend`.
      [1, 8, 41]
  user_status_api:
    reference: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfeQxJ2SUfk
    value: Okta provides an API to list users with a filter query parameter to retrieve
      users by status, such as "SUSPENDED" or "ACTIVE". The user status indicates
      whether administrative or user action is required. Possible statuses include
      STAGED, PENDING_USER_ACTION, ACTIVE, PASSWORD_RESET, PASSWORD_EXPIRED, LOCKED_OUT,
      SUSPENDED, and DEPROVISIONED. [4, 29, 47] The "PROVISIONED" status indicates
      a user without credentials who cannot log in, similar to "ACTIVE" once credentials
      are set. [15]
  user_toggle_api:
    reference: https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/api/users/
    value: Okta offers APIs for user lifecycle operations, which include activating,
      reactivating, and deactivating users. Suspending a user is a distinct lifecycle
      operation that changes the user's status to "SUSPENDED" and prevents access
      to applications, the Admin Console, or the Okta End-User Dashboard, while leaving
      application assignments unaffected. Deactivating a user removes all application
      assignments and permanently deletes the password. [8, 29, 47] The API to suspend
      a user is explicitly available. [1, 41]
