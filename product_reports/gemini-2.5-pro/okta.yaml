    "Okta recommends using scoped OAuth 2.0 access tokens for API authentication.
    This is the most secure method. The steps are: \n1. In the Okta Admin Console,
    navigate to Applications > Applications. \n2. Create a new App Integration of
    type 'API Services'. \n3. In the new application, go to the 'Okta API Scopes'
    tab. \n4. Grant the required scopes (e.g., okta.users.manage, okta.groups.read).
    \n5. Use the Client ID and Secret from the 'General' tab with the OAuth 2.0 client
    credentials flow to obtain a bearer token. \n\nAn older, simpler method uses
    a legacy SSWS API token: \n1. Navigate to Security > API > Tokens. \n2. Click
    'Create Token'. \n3. Name the token and copy the generated value. This token
    is used in an 'Authorization' header as 'SSWS {token}'. [7, 16, 20]"

 Security Monitoring and Incident Response Analysis

This report provides a detailed analysis of the security monitoring and incident response capabilities of the Okta Identity Cloud. The investigation, conducted across multiple languages, focuses on identifying key security logs, remediation actions, and log export mechanisms available within the platform.

### Executive Summary

Okta offers a comprehensive suite of security features, centered around its System Log, which provides a detailed audit trail of events within an organization's Okta environment. This, combined with a robust API for user and session management and the powerful Okta Workflows for automation, provides a strong foundation for security monitoring and incident response.

**Security Monitoring:** At the core of Okta's monitoring capabilities is the **System Log**, which captures a wide range of security-relevant events, from user authentication to administrative actions and policy changes. These logs can be accessed via the Admin Console, the System Log API, and through direct log streaming integrations with popular SIEM platforms like Splunk and cloud services such as AWS EventBridge. While basic log access is available across most license tiers, advanced features like Log Streaming are typically included in higher-tier plans or as add-ons.

**Incident Response:** Okta provides a rich set of APIs for programmatic incident response. Security teams can suspend users, clear user sessions (including OAuth tokens), and revoke API tokens to contain threats. The Users API and Sessions API are the primary tools for these actions. For more complex response scenarios, **Okta Workflows** offers a no-code automation platform with pre-built templates for common security use cases, such as responding to suspicious activity reports and managing user access based on threat intelligence. Several open-source tools on GitHub also provide command-line and programmatic access to these response functions.

The following sections provide a detailed breakdown of the available security logs, remediation actions, and log export mechanisms, along with their technical specifications, licensing requirements, and supporting documentation.
