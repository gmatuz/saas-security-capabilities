  lifecycle_options:
    value: WordPress supports user states such as newly added, active, and disabled
      (without deleting). Users can be added manually through the dashboard or via
      front-end registration forms (often with plugins). Roles can be changed to effectively
      disable a user's capabilities without deleting their account. Default roles
      include Administrator, Editor, Author, Contributor, and Subscriber. Custom roles
      and capabilities can also be defined.
  rbac_api_assignment:
    reference: https://reintech.io/blog/custom-user-roles-wordpress-api
    value: yes - Roles and capabilities can be assigned and managed programmatically
      through the WordPress API. Functions like `add_role()`, `remove_role()`, `add_cap()`,
      and `remove_cap()` can be used to create, modify, or delete roles and their
      associated capabilities. User roles can also be assigned when creating or updating
      users via the REST API.
  rbac_support:
    reference: https://reintech.io/blog/custom-user-roles-wordpress-api
    value: yes - WordPress has a robust User Roles and Capabilities system. Each user
      is assigned a role (e.g., Administrator, Editor, Author, Contributor, Subscriber),
      which dictates their capabilities (permissions) to perform various actions on
      the site. Custom roles and capabilities can also be created and managed. [7,

  user_management_api_authentication_acquisition_steps:
    reference: https://woocommerce.com/document/woocommerce-rest-api/
    value: For Basic Authentication with Application Passwords (since WordPress 5.6),
      users can generate application passwords from their 'Edit User' page (wp-admin
      -> Users -> Edit User). These credentials are then passed to REST API requests
      over HTTPS. For API Key authentication, if supported by a plugin (e.g., WooCommerce
      REST API), keys can be created and managed under WooCommerce > Settings > Advanced
      > REST API.
  user_management_api_authentication_mechanisms:
    reference: https://developer.wordpress.org/rest-api/using-the-rest-api/authentication/
    value: Cookie authentication (default), Basic Authentication with Application
      Passwords, OAuth, JWT (JSON Web Token), and API Key authentication. Plugins
      can provide additional authentication methods.
  user_management_api_licensing_level:
    reference: https://pluginsforwp.com/
    value: Uncertain. The core WordPress REST API for user management is generally
      available, but advanced features such as bulk operations, custom forms, and
      integrations often rely on plugins, which may have free and premium tiers. [17,
      18, 20, 25]
  user_management_api_support:
    reference: https://developer.wordpress.org/rest-api/reference/users/
    value: yes - WordPress has a REST API that allows for managing users, including
      creating, updating, and retrieving user information. Additionally, various plugins
      extend this functionality to support bulk user operations like import/export
      and updates via CSV files.

      reference: https://underconstructionpage.com/blog/can-a-siem-be-used-to-monitor-a-wordpress-site/
      value: WordPress itself does not have built-in SIEM integration, but security
        plugins like WP Activity Log and Wordfence can track user logins and logouts,
        as well as failed login attempts. [1, 8, 9, 10, 12, 14, 21, 30, 31, 33] These
        logs typically include the date and time, the user, their role, and the IP
        address. [15]
  event_logs_licensing_level:
    reference: hallucinated link doublecheck content
    value: While basic activity logging is available in free versions of plugins like
      WP Activity Log and Wordfence, advanced features such as external database integration,

      logs, application logs), and provide real-time alerts for suspicious activity.
      These systems can also be configured for automated responses, such as blocking
      an IP address during brute-force attacks.
  revoke_api_key_api:
    reference: https://wordpress.org/support/topic/errors-deleting-products-and-api-keys/
    value: WordPress itself doesn't have a concept of 'API keys' for users in the
      same way a SaaS application might. User authentication typically relies on cookies
      and session management. However, plugins might introduce their own API key mechanisms,
      and their revocation would depend on the specific plugin's implementation. The
      WordPress REST API uses authentication methods like cookie authentication for
      logged-in users and application passwords. Revoking an application password
      would be the closest equivalent to revoking a user-specific API key in a default
      WordPress setup. No direct 'revoke all API keys' API for a user was found in
      the core WordPress REST API documentation.
  session_timeout_configuration:
    reference: hallucinated link doublecheck content
    value: By default, WordPress login sessions expire after 48 hours, or 14 days
      if the 'Remember Me' box is checked. This duration can be customized by adding
      a filter to the `auth_cookie_expiration` hook in the `functions.php` file, allowing
      administrators to set a longer or shorter cookie expiry. Plugins like 'LoginPress
      Session Expire' or 'Login Timeout Sessions' also offer UI options to configure
      session expiration times, sometimes even per user capability.
  suspend_user_api:
    reference: https://developer.wordpress.org/rest-api/reference/users/#delete-a-user
    value: WordPress does not have a native API to 'suspend' users. Instead, user
      management typically involves changing user roles and capabilities, or deleting
      the user. While the REST API allows for user deletion, it does not offer a direct
      'suspend' functionality. However, some plugins might introduce this feature
      through their own APIs or interfaces.
  user_status_api:
    reference: https://wordpress.stackexchange.com/questions/276082/what-the-user-status-column
    value: While WordPress has an API for managing user roles and capabilities (`User
      Roles API`), which defines what a user can or cannot do, there isn't a direct
      API to check if a user is 'active' (can log in) versus 'suspended' or 'disabled'
      in a general sense. User activity can be monitored through logging plugins.
  user_toggle_api:
    reference: https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/wp_destroy_other_sessions/
    value: WordPress does not have a direct API to 'toggle' user status between active
      and suspended/disabled in a way that would automatically disable active sessions.
      User deletion is possible via the REST API or `wp_delete_user()` function. [10,
      11, 16] Changes to user roles and capabilities can restrict a user's access,
      but this does not inherently invalidate existing sessions.
