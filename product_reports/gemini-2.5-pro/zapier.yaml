  user_management_api_support:
    reference: https://help.zapier.com/hc/en-us/articles/8496291497741-Provision-user-accounts-with-SCIM
    value: yes - Zapier offers a SCIM-compliant REST API for user provisioning, which
      supports creating, updating, and deactivating users. While there isn't documentation
      for a separate generic user management API, Zapier's platform allows automation
      of user-related tasks (e.g., invites, role assignments) through its 'Zaps' by
      connecting with various apps that handle user data, and it exposes webhooks
      for custom API calls.

      reference: https://help.zapier.com/hc/en-us/articles/13295074298125-Use-the-audit-log-to-review-your-account-activity
      value: Zapier provides audit logs that track user and automation activities,
        ensuring transparency and compliance for enterprise security teams. These
        logs include records of when a user in the account logged onto Zapier. [3,
        11]

  invalidate_sessions_api:
    reference: https://allquiet.app/integrations/outbound/zapier
    value: Zapier does not explicitly provide a public API for programmatically invalidating
      all or specific user sessions. However, in the event of a security incident,
      Zapier has the capability to revoke unauthorized user access, as demonstrated
      when they immediately revoked access following a code repository breach. [7,
      34] The platform supports Session Authentication for integrations to maintain
      session state across requests, which might imply underlying session management,
      but no user-facing API for invalidation is documented. [33]
  known_automation_tools:
  - reference: https://allquiet.app/integrations/outbound/zapier
    value: Zapier itself is a no-code automation tool that can connect various apps
      and services, useful for streamlining incident management by acting on triggers
      and performing actions like sending alerts to communication platforms or project
      management tools (e.g., WhatsApp, Jira, Slack, Microsoft Teams). [1, 3, 4, 8,
      16, 26]
  - reference: https://zapier.com/blog/protect-your-site-improve-security-with-automation/
    value: SOAR (Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response) platforms like
      Tines can integrate with Zapier-like functionality for automating incident response,
      allowing for orchestration of security tools and workflows based on alerts.
      [4, 27, 40, 41] Datadog and PagerDuty are listed as security tools that integrate
      with Zapier for incident reporting and alerting. [2, 4, 10, 22]
  - reference: https://zapier.com/blog/protect-your-site-improve-security-with-automation/
    value: SIEM (Security Information and Event Management) tools like Datadog and
      Panther integrate with Zapier for centralized log management, real-time threat
      detection, and incident response. [4, 5, 10, 14]
  - reference: https://www.npmjs.com/package/zapier-platform-cli
    value: For developers building Zapier integrations, the `zapier-platform-cli`
      npm package is available for building integrations with Zapier. [32] The `@zapier/ai-actions`
      npm package serves as an API client for AI Actions by Zapier. [13]
  - reference: https://n8n.io/
    value: Other automation platforms like n8n and Trigger.dev are alternatives that
      offer code-based or low-code approaches to building AI agents and workflows,
      including sophisticated event engines for orchestrating responses and managing
      async tasks. [37, 38]
  revoke_api_key_api:
    reference: https://allquiet.app/integrations/outbound/zapier
    value: While there isn't a direct API to revoke Zapier account API keys, users
      are urged to rotate plain text authentication tokens used in webhooks or code
      following incidents. [7, 34] For third-party applications integrated with Zapier,
      it is possible to revoke their access from the 'Authorized Applications' page
      in Zapier's settings. [23] For applications built on platforms like Buildfire,
      Zapier can be used to ban or remove users by leveraging the application's own
      API key. [15]
  session_timeout_configuration:
    reference: https://community.zapier.com/how-do-i-3/how-to-set-max-request-timeout-for-integration-47904
    value: The session timeout for a single HTTP request in Zapier is 30 seconds and
      cannot be changed or extended for integrations. [12] For general user sessions
      within a platform, external documentation for products that integrate with Zapier
      indicates configurable session timeouts, for example, from 15 minutes to 8 hours.
      [42] Zapier itself recommends multi-factor authentication and regular review
      of audit logs and authorized applications for security. [23]
  suspend_user_api:
    reference: https://community.zapier.com/how-do-i-3/how-to-deactivate-remove-users-in-zapier-using-zapier-s-own-api-19962
    value: Zapier does not have a public API for managing Zapier accounts, including
      deactivating or suspending users. While it is possible to remove members from
      a Zapier Team or Enterprise account through the UI, or via SCIM if enabled,
      there is no direct programmatic API for this action from Zapier's side. [9,
      29]
  user_status_api:
    reference: https://community.zapier.com/how-do-i-3/how-to-deactivate-remove-users-in-zapier-using-zapier-s-own-api-19962
    value: Uncertain. While Zapier offers role-based access and audit logs for oversight
      of user activity [11], and it is possible to remove members from a Team or Enterprise
      account [29], there is no explicit public API to programmatically check if a
      Zapier user is active, suspended, or disabled. User status information is primarily
      managed through the administrative UI or via SCIM if enabled. [29]
  user_toggle_api:
    reference: https://community.zapier.com/how-do-i-3/how-to-deactivate-remove-users-in-zapier-using-zapier-s-own-api-19962
    value: Uncertain. There is no direct programmatic API documented for toggling
      user status (active/suspended/disabled) within Zapier itself that would automatically
      disable active sessions. User removal from a Team or Enterprise account is a
      manual UI action or handled via SCIM, and it allows for configuring how long
      private app connections remain active (30 days or until their app's expiration
      schedule), rather than immediately disabling active sessions. [29]
