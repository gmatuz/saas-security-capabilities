  event_logs:
    api_call:
      reference: https://www.zoho.com/crm/developer/docs/api/v8/create-export-audit-log.html
      value: Zoho CRM offers an API to export audit log data. This is an asynchronous
        API where an export job is scheduled. The exported logs can be downloaded
        as CSV or ZIP files. The status of the export job can be checked, and results
        downloaded using specific APIs. Filters can be applied for specific audit
        entries, including by user IDs (obtained via GET Users API) and module API
        names/IDs (obtained via GET Module Metadata API). The audited time range for
        filtering should not exceed 180 days, though the API can export up to the
        last three years of data by default.
    configuration_change:
      reference: hallucinated link doublecheck content
      value: Zoho CRM's Audit Log captures actions performed in the Setup features,
        including changes to Email Templates, Inventory Templates, Mail Merge Templates,
        Workflow Rules, Auto Response Rules, Case Escalation Rules, Webhooks, Business
        Hours, Roles, Profiles, Groups, Reports & Report Folders, Assignment Rules,
        and Web Tabs. These logs include creation, deletion, and editing actions.
        Specifically, changes made to workflow rules, such as creation, editing, updating,
        deleting, modifying, locking, or adding actions, are displayed in the audit
        log.
    data_export:
      reference: https://www.postman.com/zohocrmdevelopers/zoho-crm-developers/folder/ntd0nws/export-audit-log-api
      value: Audit logs track import and export records for various modules like Leads,
        Accounts, Contacts, Deals, Activities, Cases, and Price Books. Additionally,
        the Export Audit Log API allows exporting a comprehensive history of user
        actions in CSV or ZIP format.
    role_assignment:
      reference: hallucinated link doublecheck content
      value: The Audit Log captures changes related to 'Roles, Profiles, Groups' under
        the Setup features, including creation, deletion, and editing actions.
    security_policy_change:
      reference: https://www.zoho.com/crm/data-security.html
      value: While general configuration changes are logged, specific details on 'security
        policy changes' such as changes to IP restrictions or two-factor authentication
        settings are uncertain from the provided documentation. However, Zoho CRM
        offers features like IP whitelisting and two-factor authentication for security.
    user_account_creation:
      reference: hallucinated link doublecheck content
      value: The Audit Log captures 'Add' and 'Edit Details' actions for 'Users' under
        the Setup features. This indicates that user account creation and modification
        are logged.
    user_login:
      reference: https://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/faqs/audit-log/articles/audit-logs-3-2-2023
      value: Zoho CRM's audit log does not capture user login histories directly.
        Login history is managed and found within Zoho Directory. The audit logs focus
        on actions performed by users within the CRM itself.
  event_logs_licensing_level:
    reference: hallucinated link doublecheck content
    value: Access to the Audit Log in Zoho CRM depends on the user's role. Administrators
      and users with the CEO role can view audit logs for all users. Regular users
      can only view their own audit logs and those of their direct subordinates. It
      is available by default with Zoho CRM instances that have audit log functionality,
      implying it is not tied to a specific higher-tier licensing level for basic
      access beyond standard administrator privileges.
  ingestion_methods:
  - reference: https://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/faqs/audit-log/articles/audit-logs-3-2-2023

      interface.
  - reference: https://www.zoho.com/crm/developer/docs/api/v8/download-export-audit-log-result.html
    value: Zoho CRM provides an asynchronous API to export audit log data. The exported
      logs can be downloaded as CSV or ZIP files once the export job is complete.
      This allows for programmatic retrieval of audit logs.
  - reference: https://www.reddit.com/r/Zoho/comments/1junl30/processing_zoho_audit_log/
    value: Scheduler functions can be used within Zoho CRM to automate the process
      of triggering the Export Audit Log API and then downloading the CSV file using
      the Download Export Audit Log Result API.
  - reference: https://www.reddit.com/r/Zoho/comments/1junl30/processing_zoho_audit_log/
    value: A custom app or middleware can be used outside Zoho CRM to call the Export
      Audit Log API, wait for the job to finish, download the CSV using the job ID,
      and then push the file into Zoho Analytics through the Analytics API.
  log_export_options:
    tools_connectors:
      reference: hallucinated link doublecheck content
      value: Zoho CRM provides a direct option to export audit log entries in CSV
        format from the Audit Log page in the setup menu. Additionally, there is an
        Export Audit Log API that supports exporting logs as CSV or ZIP files. Users
        can also leverage integration platforms like n8n.io and Zapier to connect
        Zoho CRM with SIEMs or other monitoring tools, facilitating automated data
        transfer.
  monitoring_products:
  - reference: https://n8n.io/integrations/qradar/and/zoho-crm/
    value: QRadar can connect with Zoho CRM using n8n.io to automate workflows and
      transfer data. This integration involves configuring nodes for both QRadar and
      Zoho CRM in the n8n interface.
  - reference: https://zapier.com/
    value: Zapier can be used to connect Zoho CRM with other applications and offers
      features like audit logs, analytics, and real-time alerts for monitoring workflows.
  - reference: https://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/vault/integration-guide/siem-services/articles/password-manager-syslog-siem-integration
    value: Zoho Vault integrates with popular SIEM tools such as Loggly, Logz.io,
      Sematext, Sumo Logic, Timber, Microsoft Sentinel, and Datadog. This integration
      allows organizations to manage their Zoho Vault audit logs from their SIEM service.
  - reference: https://www.zohoflow.com/apps/zoho-crm/integrations/servicedesk-msp-on-premises/
    value: Zoho CRM can be connected with Zoho Flow to automate business workflows.

  invalidate_sessions_api:
    reference: https://www.zoho.com/accounts/protocol/oauth/revoke-refresh-token.html
    value: OAuth access and refresh tokens, used for API authentication, can be programmatically
      revoked by making a POST request to Zoho's OAuth token revocation endpoint.
      Revoking a refresh token also invalidates all associated access tokens. However,
      no specific API was found to invalidate all active user *login sessions* within
      the Zoho CRM UI directly.
  known_automation_tools:
  - reference: https://www.postman.com/zohocrmdevelopers/zoho-crm-developers/documentation/4128ndc/zoho-crm-rest-apis
    value: Zoho CRM provides REST APIs for various operations, including user management
      and data manipulation, which can be used for custom automation and integration.
  - reference: https://github.com/zoho/zohocrm-nodejs-sdk-8.0
    value: Official Node.js SDKs for Zoho CRM APIs (v7.0 and v8.0) are available,
      serving as wrappers for the REST APIs and streamlining OAuth2.0 authentication
      and token management, simplifying development of integrations.
  - reference: https://www.aorborc.com/monitor-zoho-crm-user-activity-audit-log-guide/
    value: Zoho CRM provides comprehensive audit logs that record user actions, which
      can be reviewed for investigation and monitoring of suspicious activities through
      the UI.
  revoke_api_key_api:
    reference: https://www.zoho.com/crm/developer/docs/functions/serverless-fn-apikey.html
    value: For Zoho CRM's serverless functions, administrators can regenerate API
      keys, which immediately invalidates the old key. For OAuth, refresh tokens can
      be programmatically revoked, which also revokes all access tokens generated
      from them.
  session_timeout_configuration:
    reference: https://www.zoho.com/docs/help/configure-session-management.html
    value: Uncertain. While Zoho CRM offers advanced authentication features like
      two-factor authentication and configurable password policies for enhanced login
      security, specific details regarding the programmatic configuration of session
      timeout durations, including minimum values, were not explicitly found in the
      provided search results.
  suspend_user_api:
    reference: https://www.zoho.com/analytics/api/v1/usermanagement-api/deactivate-user.html
    value: Zoho CRM allows for deactivating users via UI, which prevents their access.
      Programmatic deactivation for Zoho CRM Portal users is available through the
      'Change User's Status' API. While a direct API for suspending general CRM users
      was not explicitly found, the 'Deactivate Users' API for Zoho Analytics suggests
      a similar capability might exist or could be extended to Zoho CRM.
  user_status_api:
    reference: https://www.zoho.com/crm/developer/docs/api/v8/get-users.html
    value: The Zoho CRM Users API allows retrieving user data, including their status
      (active or inactive). This can be achieved by specifying parameters like 'type=AllUsers',
      'type=ActiveUsers', or 'type=DeactiveUsers' in the API request.
  user_toggle_api:
    reference: https://www.zoho.com/crm/developer/docs/api/v8/change-user-status-portal.html
    value: Zoho CRM allows deactivating and activating users through the UI. When
      a user is deactivated, they lose access to the CRM. The 'Change User's Status'
      API for Zoho CRM Portals explicitly supports programmatic activation/deactivation
      of portal users. While not explicitly stated for general CRM users, the ability
      to deactivate a user through the UI would imply session invalidation upon deactivation.
