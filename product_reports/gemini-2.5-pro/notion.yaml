  rbac_api_assignment:
    reference: https://notionmastery.com/notion-member-onboarding-with-scim/
    value: yes - SCIM supports provisioning groups and group memberships, which allows
      for managing user access to Notion teamspaces and content via groups defined
      in the Identity Provider. The Notion API allows for sharing pages/databases
      with integrations, which could be part of a bespoke RBAC solution.
  rbac_support:
    reference: https://www.windmill.dev/
    value: yes - Notion supports granular admin roles (Enterprise Plan), advanced
      teamspace permissions (Enterprise Plan), and private teamspaces (Business Plan
      and Enterprise Plan). Permissions can be set at the page level. SCIM can provision
      groups and group memberships.

  user_management_api_authentication_acquisition_steps:
    reference: https://automation-docs.rea.pro/integrations/builtin/credentials/notion/
    value: 'For Internal Integration Token (API Key): 1. Log in to Notion as a Workspace
      Owner. 2. Access ''My integrations'' in the Notion developer portal. 3. Click
      ''+ New integration''. 4. Name the integration and select an associated workspace.
      5. Click ''Submit''. 6. On the integration''s page, go to the ''Secrets'' section,
      click ''Show'' and copy the token. 7. The integration then needs to be shared
      with specific pages or databases to access their content. For Public OAuth Integration:
      1. Create a new integration on the Notion developers page to obtain a client
      ID and client secret. 2. Implement an OAuth 2.0 flow: redirect users to Notion''s
      authorization page, handle the callback to receive an authorization code, and
      exchange this code for an access token using a POST request to `https://api.notion.com/v1/oauth/token`
      with Basic Authentication.'
  user_management_api_authentication_mechanisms:
    reference: hallucinated link doublecheck content
    value: Bearer Tokens (API keys) for internal integrations, OAuth 2.0 for public
      integrations. Basic Authentication is used when exchanging an OAuth code for
      an access token.
  user_management_api_licensing_level:
    reference: hallucinated link doublecheck content
    value: uncertain - The Notion API itself is available for use by anyone, but access
      to certain features or the ability to create integrations might be tied to a
      Notion account. While the API itself is not explicitly tied to a paid plan for
      basic usage, leveraging it for robust user management might require functionalities
      available on paid plans, particularly the Enterprise plan for SCIM-based provisioning.
  user_management_api_support:
    reference: hallucinated link doublecheck content
    value: yes - Notion API is not strictly a user management API, but allows for
      creating and managing 'integrations' which can interact with Notion data. These
      integrations can be used to read and write content, and a user creating an integration
      must grant it specific permissions. The API can create/retrieve pages and databases
      and interact with data within them, which can be leveraged for user-related
      actions indirectly.

      reference: https://www.notion.com/help/add-security-and-compliance-integrations
      value: Notion's SIEM integrations can receive webhook events that correspond
        to audit log events. While a direct 'API call' event schema isn't explicitly
        detailed, the existence of API keys for SIEM integrations and the use of HTTP
        Request nodes in tools like n8n suggest that API interactions are part of
        the logged activities.

    value: API keys for Notion integrations can be revoked by deleting the integration
      from the integration dashboard. A new integration with the same capabilities
      can then be created. Notion recommends immediately revoking a compromised key
      and generating a new one.
  session_timeout_configuration:
    reference: https://notion.helloapi.co/api-playground/settings
    value: Uncertain. There is no specific documentation found regarding session timeout
      configuration in Notion.
  suspend_user_api:

    value: Notion's API has an endpoint (PATCH /users/{userId}) to suspend or reactivate
      existing app users. Additionally, Notion workspace owners can manually suspend
      users through the managed user dashboard on the Enterprise plan, which prevents
