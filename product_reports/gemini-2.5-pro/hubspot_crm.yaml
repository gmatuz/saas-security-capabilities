      via SAML assertion rather than directly through the SCIM API.

  suspend_user_management_api:
    value: "Yes, a user can be deactivated via the UI, which removes their access. While the main User Provisioning API (SCIM) does not appear to have a direct 'deactivate' function, community discussions suggest it is possible via other API calls, likely by setting an 'active' attribute to 'false'. Third-party management tools like Oomnitza also provide this function, confirming its existence."

  user_status_api:
    value: "No, there appears to be a known limitation. The User Provisioning (SCIM) API (GET /settings/v3/users) does not return the active/inactive status of a user, making it difficult to programmatically verify if a user is deactivated."
