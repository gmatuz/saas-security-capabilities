  event_logs:
    api_call:
      reference: https://developers.hubspot.com/docs/api/account-info/account-activity
      value: HubSpot has deprecated API Keys in favor of more secure alternatives
        like Private App Keys and OAuth authorization for API access. The Account
        Activity API allows retrieval of 'security activity' which includes actions
        related to CRM object creation, property value updates, and other security
        activities. For Enterprise accounts, there's an endpoint to retrieve an audit
        log of all user actions via the /account-info/v3/activity/audit-logs API,
        which can be filtered by acting user ID, and time range. Developers can use
        the CRM Search API to query records with sensitive data fields and leverage
        audit logs to track all changes and access to sensitive data properties. [1,
        4, 10, 12]
    configuration_change:
      reference: https://knowledge.hubspot.com/account/view-and-export-account-activity-history
      value: HubSpot's audit log records user activities such as content edits, property
        changes, and account setting modifications. Advanced auditing tools track
        user activities, and configuration changes within HubSpot. The centralized
        audit log allows viewing user actions related to system changes. The Account
        Activity API's audit logs endpoint (Enterprise only) includes actions related
        to CRM object creation and property value updates.
    data_export:
      reference: https://knowledge.hubspot.com/import-and-export/view-a-log-of-your-users-exports-in-your-account
      value: HubSpot provides an audit log for exports, which tracks when an export
        occurred, who initiated it, and which records were exported. Super Admins
        can view all account exports, while individual users can view their personal
        exports. The export audit log includes information such as file name, source
        (e.g., Contacts), number of records exported, and the user who completed the
        export. Users with Super Admin permissions can also set up notifications for
        large exports. Data can be exported in CSV or Excel (XLS or XLSX) formats
        for most data, with specific formats for other entities like quotes (PDF),
        workflows (CSV or PNG), and website pages (HTML). The Account Activity API
        can provide details about export events, but does not provide the actual exported
        file.
    role_assignment:
      reference: https://knowledge.hubspot.com/user-management/hubspot-user-permissions-guide
      value: HubSpot offers user-level security with role-based access control (RBAC)
        to restrict access to CRM data and functionality based on job responsibilities.
        While the documentation mentions controlling access through roles and permissions,
        specific audit logs detailing the assignment or modification of roles are
        not explicitly described with schema details. However, audit logs do track
        'user actions' and 'configuration changes', which would implicitly include
        role assignments.
    security_policy_change:
      reference: https://huble.com/blog/hubspot-security-compliance
      value: HubSpot's Information Security Policy is formally reviewed annually or
        when changes are identified to address business activities, the management
        of information assets, or identified shortcomings from incidents or audit
        findings. While the policy outlines the importance of security, explicit audit
        log schema for changes to security policies within the HubSpot platform itself
        are not detailed. However, configuration changes are generally logged, which
        would encompass security policy adjustments made within the platform settings.
    user_account_creation:
      reference: https://knowledge.hubspot.com/user-management/hubspot-user-permissions-guide
      value: HubSpot's audit logs maintain visibility into user activities within
        the CRM system, which would include user account creation. The centralized
        audit log and the Account Activity API's audit logs endpoint track user actions.
        While explicit schema for 'user account creation' is not detailed, 'adding
        and removing users' is mentioned as an activity in the audit log API. [1,
        4, 5]
    user_login:
      reference: https://developers.hubspot.com/docs/api/account-info/account-activity
      value: HubSpot provides a 'Login History' audit log that records user logins
        within the last 30 days. This includes successful and unsuccessful login attempts
        to app.hubspot.com and the HubSpot mobile app. The log includes details such
        as login event ID, timestamp, user ID, user email, IP address, country code,
        and region code. It's noted that mobile app logins are not consistently tracked
        in the audit log login records. The Account Activity API allows retrieval
        of login history for the past 90 days.
  event_logs_licensing_level:
    reference: https://knowledge.hubspot.com/account/view-and-export-account-activity-history
    value: Access to the comprehensive audit log of all user actions via the Account
      Activity API and the 'Analyze' tab in the Audit Logs for user analytics (total
      daily logins, deletions, exports, reports) is available for Enterprise accounts
      only. Users with Starter or Professional accounts can filter the audit logs
      by 'Login' or 'Security Activity'. To use audit logs in the settings, Super
      Admin powers in an Enterprise account are required.
  ingestion_methods:
  - reference: https://developers.hubspot.com/docs/api/account-info/account-activity
    value: The Account Activity API allows programmatic retrieval of login history
      and security activity. This API is available for login history and security
      activity, with the full audit log of user actions available for Enterprise accounts.
  - reference: https://cloud.google.com/security/community/hubspot-logs-to-chronicle
    value: For SIEM integration, direct API ingestion for HubSpot CRM audit logs is
      not currently available for Google Cloud Security Chronicle. However, logs can
      be exported to a supported format (JSON or CSV) and stored in a Cloud Storage
      bucket, which Chronicle can then ingest.
  log_export_options:
    tools_connectors:
      reference: https://knowledge.hubspot.com/account/view-and-export-account-activity-history
      value: HubSpot allows users to view, filter, and export a centralized audit
        log directly from the settings. This export typically results in a CSV file,
        which is then emailed to the user and available in notifications. There is
        no single button to export all data at once, but various data types (CRM content,
        analytics, sales data) can be exported in CSV or Excel formats. Specific APIs
        are available for exporting login history, security activity, and for Enterprise
        accounts, a full audit log of user actions.
  monitoring_products:
  - reference: https://www.manageengine.com/
    value: HubSpot has built-in event logging. Logs can be exported and ingested into
      Log Analysis or SIEM tools. Third-party tools can be leveraged for advanced
      auditing and metadata backups. SIEM solutions like ManageEngine Log360 are mentioned
      in the context of SIEM integration with HubSpot, however, direct API ingestion
      for HubSpot CRM audit logs into Google Cloud Security Chronicle is not currently
      provided, but it's possible through Cloud Storage after exporting in a supported
      format like JSON or CSV.

      https://www.polymerdlp.com/blog/hubspot-cybersecurity-incident-what-to-do
    value: Uncertain. HubSpot allows administrators to manage access controls and
      permissions. During a security incident, HubSpot internally took 'necessary
      steps to revoke the unauthorized access'. However, no specific public API or
      UI option is detailed for customers to programmatically invalidate all or specific
      sessions for a user. The deprecation of API keys in favor of Private App Keys
      and OAuth authorization is noted as enhancing security of API access.

  revoke_api_key_api:
    reference: https://www.huble.co.uk/blog/hubspot-security-compliance-best-practices-and-automated-tools,
      https://www.huble.co.uk/hubspot-security-program
    value: Uncertain. HubSpot has deprecated API Keys in favor of more secure alternatives
      like Private App Keys and OAuth authorization, which enhances the security of
      API access. Customers can generate API keys for their portals, intended for
      rapid prototyping of custom integrations. However, specific API endpoints or
      UI options for programmatically revoking existing API keys (personal or global)
      are not explicitly described in the provided search results. The general statement
      about secure API access emphasizes prevention of unauthorized access but not
      direct programmatic revocation by the customer.
  session_timeout_configuration:
    reference: https://www.huble.co.uk/blog/hubspot-security-compliance-best-practices-and-automated-tools,
      https://www.huble.co.uk/hubspot-security-program, https://www.huble.co.uk/hubspot-security-overview
    value: Uncertain. While HubSpot emphasizes robust access control policies and
      authentication methods like multi-factor authentication (MFA) and Single Sign-On
      (SSO) options to fortify account security, and recommends 2FA for users , no
      specific details regarding the configuration of session timeouts, including
      minimum values, are available in the provided search results.

      https://scmediaco.com/news/identity-incident-response/hubspot-accounts-breach-under-investigation/,
      https://www.huble.co.uk/hubspot-security-program
    value: Uncertain. While HubSpot offers robust user permissions and role-based
      access controls to restrict data access, and recent security incidents show
      HubSpot took steps to 'revoke unauthorized access' and 'deactivated and blocked
      bad actor accounts', there is no explicit mention of a public API or UI option
      for customers to programmatically suspend a user or an account, or an issue
      raised for the lack of such a feature. HubSpot's security overview mentions
      that API access is enabled through API keys or OAuth 2.0, allowing customers
      to generate API keys for custom integrations. However, the specific capabilities
      of these APIs for user suspension are not detailed in the search results.
  user_status_api:
    reference: https://www.huble.co.uk/blog/hubspot-security-compliance-best-practices-and-automated-tools,
      https://www.hubspot.com/products/crm/free, https://ubiquedigital.solutions/hubspot-crm-features-exploring-the-capabilities-of-the-premier-crm
    value: Uncertain. HubSpot offers features for managing contacts and user records
      , and their logging capabilities provide audit trails for account login history
      and security activity. However, there's no explicit mention of a dedicated API
      for customers to programmatically query or ascertain the 'active' (can log in),
      'suspended,' 'disabled,' or 'non-existent' status of a user within the HubSpot
      CRM from the provided search results.
  user_toggle_api:
    reference: https://www.huble.co.uk/blog/hubspot-security-compliance-best-practices-and-automated-tools,

      https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0hYqA00i2gQ
    value: Uncertain. While HubSpot provides user permissions and role-based access
      control, and internally took action to 'deactivate and block bad actor accounts'
      during a security incident, there is no explicit information about a public
      API to toggle user status (active/suspended/disabled) or whether such a toggle
      would automatically disable active sessions. HubSpot's automation capabilities
      primarily focus on marketing, sales, and service processes, such as triggering
      actions based on contact properties or pipeline stages.
