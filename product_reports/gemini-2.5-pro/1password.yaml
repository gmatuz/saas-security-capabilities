  scim_authentication_acquisition_steps: |
    The SCIM integration uses a self-hosted "SCIM Bridge" which authenticates to 1Password's servers. To get the required credentials (a bearer token and a `scimsession` file):
    1. Sign in to your 1Password Business account as an administrator.
    2. Click on "Integrations" in the sidebar.
    3. In the "User Provisioning" section, select your identity provider (e.g., Okta, Azure AD) or choose "Custom".
    4. Follow the on-screen instructions to start the setup process.
    5. The setup wizard will generate a bearer token and a `scimsession` file.
    6. Securely save both the bearer token and the `scimsession` file. The bearer token will be used to configure the application in your identity provider, and the `scimsession` file is used to configure the deployed SCIM bridge instance.

    1Password does not provide a direct, public-facing user management REST API for provisioning users into its Business or Enterprise plans. User lifecycle automation is primarily handled via the SCIM bridge. An alternative for programmatic management is the 1Password CLI (`op`).

    To use the 1Password CLI for user management, you need to authenticate it first:
    1. Install the 1Password CLI on your system.
    2. Open the 1Password desktop application and navigate to Settings > Developer.
    3. Enable the "Integrate with 1Password CLI" option.
    4. In your terminal, run an `op` command (e.g., `op vault list`).
    5. The CLI will prompt you to authorize the integration with the desktop app, which may require your account password or biometrics.
    6. Once authenticated, you can use commands like `op user provision`, `op user suspend`, etc. for scripting.
