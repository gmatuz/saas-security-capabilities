  rbac_api_assignment:
    reference: https://support.1password.com/scim-okta/
    value: yes - Group assignments and management of roles and permissions can be
      done via SCIM integration with identity providers like Okta, Azure AD, and Google
      Workspace. The SCIM bridge allows for provisioning and deprovisioning of users
      and groups, and controlling access to groups.
  rbac_support:
    reference: https://www.1password.community/kb/1password-launch-kit/setting-up-1password-for-large-organizations/687
    value: yes - 1Password supports Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) with features
      like custom group management, 13 vault permissions, and the ability to assign
      roles and permissions to team members.
  scim_authentication_acquisition_steps:
    reference: https://support.1password.com/scim/
    value: 1. Log in to your 1Password Business account. 2. Navigate to 'Integrations'
      in the sidebar. 3. Choose your identity provider from the 'User Provisioning'
      section. 4. Follow the guided deployment or custom deployment instructions.
      5. This process will generate a 'scimsession' file and a bearer token. 6. Save
      both the 'scimsession' file (locally and in 1Password) and the bearer token
      (in 1Password) for deployment and connection to your identity provider. [17,
      22, 25, 31]
  scim_authentication_mechanisms:
    reference: https://support.1password.com/scim-troubleshooting/
    value: Bearer Token. The SCIM bridge setup generates a scimsession file and a
      bearer token, which are used to authenticate the SCIM bridge with 1Password
      and the identity provider.
  scim_licensing_level_requirement:
    reference: https://support.1password.com/scim/
    value: SCIM provisioning is available with 1Password Business and Enterprise plans.
  scim_support:
    reference: https://support.1password.com/scim/
    value: yes - 1Password Business uses a SCIM bridge, which is compatible with SCIM
      2.0. This bridge connects 1Password with identity providers such as Azure Active
      Directory (Entra ID), Google Workspace, JumpCloud, Okta, OneLogin, and Rippling
      for automated user provisioning and deprovisioning. The SCIM bridge needs to
      be deployed in your own environment (on-premise or cloud). [8, 10, 12, 17, 19,
      21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 34, 36, 38, 41]

  sso_license_level_requirement:
    reference: hallucinated link doublecheck content
    value: SSO support is available for 1Password Business and Enterprise plans. [2,
      6, 9, 13, 14, 15]
  sso_support:
    reference: https://support.1password.com/sso/
    value: yes - 1Password Business supports SSO authentication. It integrates with
      identity providers like Okta, Azure AD (Entra ID), OneLogin, and Duo. SSO for
      1Password utilizes OpenID Connect (OIDC) rather than SAML directly. Owners cannot
      unlock 1Password with SSO and must use their account password and Secret Key.
  user_management_api_authentication_acquisition_steps:
    reference: https://support.1password.com/events-reporting/#appendix-issue-or-revoke-bearer-tokens
    value: For SCIM bearer token acquisition, see 'scim_authentication_acquisition_steps'.
      For 1Password API bearer tokens (e.g., for event reporting), you would typically
      issue or revoke them from the 1Password administration interface. [17, 22, 25,
      31, 42]
  user_management_api_authentication_mechanisms:
    reference: https://support.1password.com/events-reporting/#appendix-issue-or-revoke-bearer-tokens
    value: Bearer Tokens are used to acquire event data through the 1Password API.
      For the SCIM bridge, bearer tokens are also used for authentication. [17, 19,
      22, 25, 29, 31, 42]
  user_management_api_licensing_level:
    reference: hallucinated link doublecheck content
    value: Uncertain. The SCIM bridge, which is the primary automation tool for user
      management, requires a Business or Enterprise plan. [6, 12, 18, 21, 23, 24,
      25, 38] Information specifically on a non-SCIM user management API and its licensing
      is uncertain.
  user_management_api_support:
    reference: hallucinated link doublecheck content
    value: yes - 1Password provides a SCIM API for user and group provisioning. While
      the primary method for automated user lifecycle management is through the SCIM
      bridge, 1Password Connect is an API that allows for programmatic access to items
      in vaults, which could be part of a broader automation strategy. It is not a
      direct user management API in the sense of creating/disabling/deleting users
      of 1Password itself, but rather interacting with the data stored within. [28,
      42]

      value: Audit events captured by the 1Password Activity Log include team member
        and guest invitations, and changes to user access.
    user_login:
      reference: https://support.1password.com/activity-log/
      value: 1Password Business accounts provide an Activity Log that tracks important
        events, including successful and failed sign-in attempts. These logs include
        the name and IP address of the user who attempted to sign in, the time of
        the attempt, and the cause of failure for unsuccessful attempts.
  event_logs_licensing_level:
    reference: https://docs.rapid7.com/insightidr/1password/
    value: Access to the Activity Log, reports, and the 1Password Events API for security
      logging, including audit events, item usage, and sign-in attempts, requires
      a 1Password Business or Enterprise account. [1, 2, 3, 8, 10, 13, 15, 19, 22,
      26, 30, 36]
  ingestion_methods:
  - reference: https://docs.rapid7.com/insightidr/1password/

      configuring a Linux host to run commands to collect 1Password audit logs using
      Bindplane.
  log_export_options:
    tools_connectors:
      reference: https://support.1password.com/activity-log/
      value: The 1Password Activity Log can be exported to a CSV file. For SIEM integration,
        the primary method is through the 1Password Events API, which provides audit
        events, item usage, and sign-in attempts. This API can be connected to various
        SIEM platforms directly or via vendor-specific connectors/add-ons. Bearer
        tokens are used for authentication to the Events API. [1, 2, 3, 7, 8, 10,
