      ClickUp supports Single Sign-On (SSO) via SAML 2.0, allowing integration with various Identity Providers (IdPs). It has dedicated integrations for Google, Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure AD), and Okta. It also supports custom SAML configurations for other IdPs like Duo and JumpCloud. [4, 5, 12, 16, 18]

    SCIM is available on the Enterprise Plan and requires SSO to be configured first. The SCIM token is generated within the ClickUp user interface after setting up an SSO provider.
    1. Log in to ClickUp as a Workspace owner or admin.
    2. Click on the Workspace avatar in the corner of the screen.
    3. Select 'Security & Permissions'.
    4. In the 'Single sign-on (SSO)' section, configure your chosen SSO provider (e.g., Okta, SAML).
    5. After successfully configuring SSO, a 'SCIM Base URL' and 'SCIM API Token' will be displayed on the same page. [3, 6]
    6. Copy the 'SCIM API Token'. This token is used as the Bearer Token for authenticating SCIM API requests from your Identity Provider. [2, 6]

  user_management_api_authentication_acquisition_steps: |-
    ClickUp's API V2 supports two authentication methods: Personal API Token and OAuth2. For user management automation, a Personal API Token is the most direct method.
    1. Log in to your ClickUp account.
    2. Click your user avatar in the corner of the screen.
    3. Select 'Settings'. [15]
    4. In the left sidebar, click 'Apps'.
    5. At the top of the page, you will see the 'API Token' section.
    6. Click the 'Generate' button to create a new personal token. These tokens begin with 'pk_'. [14, 15]
    7. Copy the token.
    8. To authenticate API requests, include this token in the 'Authorization' header. For example: `Authorization: pk_xxxxxxxxxxxxxx`. [14, 28]

      Yes, role assignments can be managed via the API. When provisioning users via SCIM with providers like Okta or Microsoft Entra ID, a role attribute can be mapped and sent to ClickUp. The API also supports managing Teams (groups) and assigning users to them. Custom roles created in ClickUp can also be assigned via SCIM. [3, 6, 12]
