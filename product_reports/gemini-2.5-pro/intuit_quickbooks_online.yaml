  rbac_api_assignment:
    reference: hallucinated link doublecheck content
    value: yes - The Intuit Ecosystem API allows apps to retrieve basic user role
      information, including whether users are admins or employees, and their active/inactive
      status. This enables building features around role-specific workflows and checking
      permissions.

    value: uncertain - The QuickBooks Online integration add-on for Foundant's Grant
      Lifecycle Manager, which includes SSO, is available for all license types. However,
      this specifically refers to an add-on product. For direct QuickBooks Online
      SSO, no explicit license level requirement is stated in the search results.
  sso_support:
    reference: https://www.onelogin.com/connector/quickbooks%20qbo
    value: yes - supports OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect. Integrations with OneLogin
      and Auth0 are explicitly mentioned. OneLogin uses SAML for SSO. [18, 22, 28,
      29, 31]

    reference: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59577398/how-can-i-authenticate-my-quickbook-intuit-api-access-without-user-interection-a
    value: 1. Create an app on the Intuit Developer Portal and select the QuickBooks
      Online Accounting scope. 2. Obtain Client ID and Client Secret from the 'Keys
      & OAuth' section in your app's production or development settings. 3. Implement
      OAuth 2.0 flow to exchange Client ID and Client Secret for an authorization
      code, then for access tokens and refresh tokens. 4. Store the OAuth access and
      refresh tokens. Access tokens are valid for 1 hour, and a refresh token mechanism
      is used to obtain new access tokens without user interaction.
  user_management_api_authentication_mechanisms:
    reference: https://developer.intuit.com/app/developer/qbo/docs/develop/authentication-and-authorization/oauth-2.0
    value: OAuth 2.0 with access tokens. Client ID and Client Secret are used for
      authorization.

  event_logs:
    api_call:
      reference: hallucinated link doublecheck content
      value: There is no API available in QuickBooks Online specifically to retrieve
        audit log details. While QuickBooks does offer a ChangeDataCapture endpoint
        for accounting entities, it's not designed for security audit logs. Third-party
        app integrations that send data to QuickBooks or make changes to existing
        data will appear as 'System Administration' events in the audit log. [8, 11,
        14, 15, 20, 22]
    configuration_change:
      reference: https://quickbooks.intuit.com/learn-support/en-ca/help-article/audit-log/use-audit-log-quickbooks-online/L2WoVnW6I_CA_en_CA
      value: QuickBooks Online's audit log tracks changes to QuickBooks settings.
        This includes changes made automatically by 'System Administration' users,
        such as those triggered by record modifications affecting other records, third-party
        app integrations, or recurring transactions. [2, 4, 5, 11, 12, 13, 15, 20,
        22]
    data_export:
      reference: hallucinated link doublecheck content
      value: The audit log in QuickBooks Online can be exported and downloaded as
        a CSV file. There is also an option to download a local copy of your data
        to your hard drive, which for QuickBooks Online Advanced users includes transaction
        and list data.
    role_assignment:
      reference: https://paygration.com/how-secure-is-my-data-in-quickbooks-online/
      value: QuickBooks Online allows for user permission and role assignment, which
        helps control access to data and features. The audit log tracks changes to
        QuickBooks settings, which would implicitly include changes to user roles
        and permissions.
    security_policy_change:
      reference: https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQFMAbnsL_IvpZv1NIyXnK09eSnykh6QoxDA0PcdCDVbc-k_unJ7BXS0-czyd4-PIKc-tu7iMaGw9iAqZUH4YnJDIhJLFkjgdrU6JkFPqDzaY3TA6gGrSOin0YVDY8wHmU-n00ZnLlQGc7l3eKIO-zq0BX4LClsZnc903lBaFB2yf9I9RrtiRB4VQC5_WITH48u0bjA2agyePvUJdiWLXVa8kpEXTDRiy_kH9-_knV42RmhAXabA
      value: The audit log tracks changes to QuickBooks settings, which would include
        security-related settings. It also records actions by 'System Administration'
        users that can be triggered by automatic events or third-party app integrations.
        QuickBooks Online maintains 'Always-On Activity Log and Audit Trail features'
        which cannot be turned off.
    user_account_creation:
      reference: https://quickbooks.intuit.com/learn-support/en-ca/help-article/audit-log/use-audit-log-quickbooks-online/L2WoVnW6I_CA_en_CA
      value: The audit log records account activity including user sign-ins and changes
        to QuickBooks settings, which implies that user account creation and modification
        would be logged. An admin is required to create new users and manage user
        permissions.
    user_login:
      reference: https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQFMAbnsL_IvpZv1NIyXnK09eSnykh6QoxDA0PcdCDVbc-k_unJ7BXS0-czyd4-PIKc-tu7iMaGw9iAqZUH4YnJDIhJLFkjgdrU6JkFPqDzaY3TA6gGrSOin0YVDY8wHmU-n00ZnLlQGc7l3eKIO-zq0BX4LClsZnc903lBaFB2yf9I9RrtiRB4VQC5_WITH48u0bjA2agyePvUJdiWLXVa8kpEXTDRiy_kH9-_knV42RmhAXabA
      value: QuickBooks Online's Audit Log records user sign-ins. However, sign-outs
        are only logged when a user explicitly selects 'Sign out'; they are not recorded
        if a user closes the browser, navigates to another website, or is automatically
        signed out due to inactivity.
  event_logs_licensing_level:
    reference: https://quickbooks.intuit.com/learn-support/en-ca/help-article/audit-log/use-audit-log-quickbooks-online/L2WoVnW6I_CA_en_CA
    value: The audit log is an always-on feature in QuickBooks Online and cannot be
      disabled. To access the audit log, a user needs to sign in as an admin. The
      availability of online backups, which include transaction and list data, is
      tied to the QuickBooks Online Advanced subscription, which is the highest-tiered
      plan.
  ingestion_methods:
  - reference: https://www.teachucomp.com/the-audit-log-in-quickbooks-online-instructions/
    value: The audit log can be exported to a CSV file.
  - reference: https://help.developer.intuit.com/s/question/0D54R0000A0XUkaSQG/how-i-access-qbo-audit-logs-with-sdk-api
    value: While there is no direct API for retrieving audit log details, QuickBooks
      provides a ChangeDataCapture API endpoint that returns a list of objects that
      have changed since a specified time. This can be used to track changes to data,
      but it is not a dedicated security log API.
  log_export_options:
    tools_connectors:
      reference: https://help.servicetitan.com/release-notes/release-notes-st-70
      value: The audit log can be exported to a CSV file from the QuickBooks Online
        interface. Additionally, a local copy of data can be downloaded. [1, 3, 19,
        21]
  monitoring_products:
  - reference: https://paygration.com/how-secure-is-my-data-in-quickbooks-online/
    value: QuickBooks Online integrates securely with third-party applications through
      the Intuit Developer Platform, which undergoes rigorous security reviews.
  - reference: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/70207834/does-quickbooks-have-any-kind-of-audit-log
    value: Some SIEM integration solutions might rely on retrieving data from the
      QuickBooks API, such as the ChangeDataCapture endpoint for tracking modified
      data.

  invalidate_sessions_api:
    reference: https://developer.intuit.com/app/developer/qbo/docs/develop/authentication-and-authorization/oauth-2.0#revoke-token-disconnect
    value: Uncertain. The Intuit Developer documentation mentions that access tokens
      can become invalid if a user disconnects their QuickBooks Online company from
      an app, which invalidates both the access token and refresh token. This suggests
      that a user-initiated disconnect will invalidate sessions tied to that application.
      However, there is no direct API or programmatic method described for an administrator
      or external system to invalidate a user's active session within QuickBooks Online.
      Session management largely revolves around OAuth tokens for app integration,
      where refresh tokens expire after 100 days of inactivity or upon user revocation
      through the app's provided revocation method.
  known_automation_tools:
  - reference: https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-quickbooks
    value: There are npm packages such as `node-quickbooks` which acts as a Node.js
      client for Intuit's QuickBooks API, and `@jacknytely/quickbooks-api` which is
      a modular TypeScript SDK. These can be used to build custom integrations and
      automation.
  - reference: https://windsor.ai/connectors/quickbooks/
    value: Windsor.ai provides a no-code QuickBooks connector to export QuickBooks
      data to various destinations, including business intelligence tools and databases,
      which can be part of an automated reporting or investigation process.
  revoke_api_key_api:
    reference: https://developer.intuit.com/app/developer/qbo/docs/develop/authentication-and-authorization/oauth-2.0#revoke-token-disconnect
    value: It is possible to programmatically revoke API tokens (access and refresh
      tokens) via the Intuit OAuth 2.0 API. This is typically done by making an API
      call to a revoke endpoint, providing either the refresh token or access token
      along with client credentials. If an app provides a way to revoke tokens, a
      response will be received from the revoke API. If a user disconnects their QuickBooks
      Online company from an app, it invalidates the access and refresh tokens. [6,
      19, 43]
  session_timeout_configuration:
    reference: hallucinated link doublecheck content
    value: Uncertain. While Intuit discusses security safeguards like password-protected
      login and SSL encryption, and mentions automatic data backups, specific details
      on configuring session timeouts for QuickBooks Online users were not found in
      the researched documentation.
  suspend_user_api:
    reference: https://developer.intuit.com/app/developer/qbo/docs/develop/apps-and-security/security-requirements
    value: Uncertain. While QuickBooks Online allows for managing user permissions
      and access levels through its UI, there's no direct API documentation found
      that explicitly describes a programmatic way to 'suspend' a user. The Intuit
      Developer platform focuses on API integrations for accounting data and operations,
      not user management within QuickBooks itself. User management appears to be
      a UI-driven function within the QuickBooks application.
  user_status_api:
    reference: https://developer.intuit.com/app/developer/qbo/docs/develop/authentication-and-authorization/oauth-2.0
    value: Uncertain. No specific API documentation was found that allows for programmatically
      checking the active, suspended, or disabled status of users within QuickBooks
      Online. The API primarily focuses on accounting data interaction. User activity
      is logged in an 'Always-On Activity Log' and 'Audit Trail' within QuickBooks
      for user and accountant review, but this is an in-application feature, not an
      API for status checks.
  user_toggle_api:
    reference: https://developer.intuit.com/app/developer/qbo/docs/develop/apps-and-security/security-requirements
    value: Uncertain. While QuickBooks Online allows for managing user permissions
      and access levels through its UI, there's no direct API documentation found
      that explicitly describes a programmatic way to 'toggle' a user's status (active/suspended/disabled)
      or how such a toggle would affect active sessions. User management appears to
      be a UI-driven function within the QuickBooks application.
