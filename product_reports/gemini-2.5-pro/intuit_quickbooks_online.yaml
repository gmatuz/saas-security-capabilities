user_management:
  sso_support:
    value: QuickBooks Online supports SSO through the "Sign in with Intuit" feature, which
      is based on the OpenID Connect protocol. This allows users to sign in to QBO
      and connected third-party applications using their Intuit credentials. It does
      not support traditional enterprise SSO via SAML 2.0 for federating with corporate
      identity providers like Azure AD or Okta.
    reference: https://developer.intuit.com/app/developer/qbo/docs/develop/authentication-and-authorization/implement-oauth-2-0/openid-connect
  sso_licensing_level_requirement:
    value: The "Sign in with Intuit" (OpenID Connect) capability is a standard feature
      of the Intuit platform and is not tied to a specific QuickBooks Online subscription
      level. It is available for all users with an Intuit account.

  scim_support:
    value: no
    reference: https://www.okta.com/integrations/quickbooks-online-by-aquera/
  scim_licensing_level_requirement:
    value: Native SCIM is not supported, so this is not applicable. Accessing SCIM-like
      functionality requires engaging with third-party providers such as Aquera or
      Rippling, which have their own licensing and subscription costs.
    reference: https://www.aquera.com/integrations/quickbooks/
  scim_authentication_mechanisms:
    value: n/a
    reference: ''
  scim_authentication_acquisition_steps: 'Native SCIM is not supported by QuickBooks
    Online. To achieve automated provisioning, a third-party tool is required. For
    example, using Aquera with Okta:

    1.  Purchase a subscription to the Aquera service.

    2.  In the Okta Integration Network (OIN), find and add the "QuickBooks Online
    by Aquera" application.

    3.  Follow Aquera''s documentation to generate an API token or configure the connection
    from their platform to your QuickBooks Online account. This typically involves
    authorizing Aquera to access your QBO data via OAuth 2.0.

    4.  Configure the Aquera application in Okta with the details provided by Aquera.

    5.  Enable provisioning (Create, Update, Deactivate users) in the Okta application''s
    "Provisioning" tab.

    value: 'no'
    reference: https://developer.intuit.com/app/developer/qbo/docs/api/accounting/all-entities/employee
  user_management_api_licensing_level:
    value: Not applicable as there is no user management API for managing QBO product
      logins. The Intuit Developer APIs, which are available to all, manage accounting
      data (like employees for payroll), not product users.
    reference: https://developer.intuit.com/app/developer/qbo/docs/get-started
  user_management_api_authentication_mechanisms:
    value: n/a
    reference: ''
  user_management_api_authentication_acquisition_steps: 'A dedicated User Management
    API for creating, updating, or deleting QuickBooks Online users (the accounts
    used to log in to the product) does not exist. While the QuickBooks Online Accounting
    API can manage "Employee" objects for payroll purposes, it cannot manage product
    access. Automating user lifecycle requires manual UI actions or third-party integration
    tools that do not use a direct user management API.
