      through Atlassian Access. For on-premise deployments (Server & Data Center),
      SSO can be enabled via Data Center features, Atlassian Crowd, or by writing
      a custom authenticator. OAuth is not considered SSO in the Atlassian environment
      for logging into Atlassian accounts; it is for authorization, not authentication.
  user_management_api_authentication_acquisition_steps:
    reference: https://support.qmetry.com/s/article/how-to-generate-the-api-token--y
    value: 1. Log in to your Jira account settings. 2. Locate the API token section

  event_logs:
    api_call:
      reference: https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/rest/v2/api-group-audit-records/
      value: Jira Cloud platform REST API provides an endpoint `/rest/api/2/auditing/record`
        (and `/rest/api/3/auditing/record` for API v3) to retrieve a list of audit
        records. [20, 27] These records can be filtered by `eventSource`, `objectItem.name`,
        `objectItem.typeName`, `changedValues.changedFrom`, `changedValues.changedTo`,
        and `remoteAddress`. [20] The logs capture activities undertaken in Jira.
        [20] The Elastic Jira integration collects audit logs from the audit API.
        [24]
    configuration_change:
      reference: https://confluence.atlassian.com/adminjiraserver/audit-log-events-in-jira-998879036.html
      value: Jira audit logs track key activities, including system configuration
        changes, which are useful for diagnosing problems and maintaining security.
        [11] Specific events logged include changes to global settings, application
        links, and add-ons. [6] Jira audit logs record when changes happen, who made
        them, the category (e.g., workflow or project modification), a summary of
        the change, and what exactly changed. [31, 25]
    data_export:
      reference: hallucinated link doublecheck content
      value: In Jira Data Center, you can export up to 100,000 events as a CSV file.
        If there are more events, only the 100,000 newest events are included. Filtered
        results can also be exported up to 100,000 events. [1] For Jira Cloud, data
        export is possible via CSV, HTML, or the API. [6] Audit logs record actions
        such as exporting external users or accounts for a verified domain. [11]
    role_assignment:
      reference: https://www.reddit.com/r/atlassian/comments/1hwey6k/how_can_i_prevent_people_in_atlassian_guard/
      value: Audit logs capture changes to role assignments. For example, the audit
        log can trace how a user came to get a license if there are concerns about
        unauthorized assignments. [41] Datadog's integration collects Jira audit logs
        which include data about activities such as account management and product
        access changes, which would cover role assignments. [6]
    security_policy_change:
      reference: https://www.datadoghq.com/blog/datadog-cloud-siem-atlassian/

      value: Jira logs security-related information, including login and logout events,
        to `atlassian-jira-security.log` in Jira Data Center. [2] For Jira Cloud,
        audit logs track key activities and can be viewed in the Jira administration
        console. [5] Common security use cases for Atlassian logs in SIEM platforms
        include monitoring for brute force login attempts or impersonator logins.
        [25]
  event_logs_licensing_level:
    reference: https://support.atlassian.com/jira-cloud-administration/docs/audit-activities-in-jira-applications/
    value: Audit logging is available only on paid Jira accounts (Standard, Premium,
      Enterprise) and not on the free plan. [36, 39, 40] For Jira Cloud, if all products
      are on the Free plan, the audit log is not available. [5] Jira Data Center provides
      audit logging capabilities, and logs can be stored in files for integration
      with third-party logging tools. [1, 7]
  monitoring_products:
  - reference: https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/azure-docs/blob/main/articles/sentinel/data-connectors/atlassian-jira-audit.md
    value: Microsoft Sentinel offers an Atlassian Jira Audit data connector that ingests
      Jira Audit Records events through the REST API. [8, 17] Jira Service Management
      also offers a webhook integration with Microsoft Sentinel. [3]
  - reference: https://support.atlassian.com/jira-service-management-cloud/docs/integrate-with-splunk/
    value: Splunk has various integrations with Jira. Jira Service Management provides
      a two-way integration with Splunk, allowing Splunk alerts to be forwarded to
      Jira Service Management and alert actions from Jira Service Management to be
      sent to Splunk as events. [3] There are Splunk add-ons available to create customized
      Jira issues based on triggered events in Splunk. [5, 8] Some users have noted
      a lack of official documentation on Jira Cloud authentication event logs for
      Splunk integration. [26]
  - reference: https://www.datadoghq.com/blog/datadog-cloud-siem-atlassian/
    value: Datadog Cloud SIEM offers integrations for Atlassian Jira and Confluence
      Audit Records and Atlassian Organization Audit Logs to collect and process audit
      logs for activities such as account management, system configuration, and product
      access changes. [6]

        the log or adding events triggered by external plugins. Microsoft Sentinel
        can ingest Jira Audit Records events through the REST API. Events generated
        by external apps that call the Jira REST API, which fall under the 'Apps'
        coverage area, are not explicitly listed in the audit log events documentation
        as they are app-dependent. [1, 8, 14]
    configuration_change:

        included. The newest events are included if there are more than 100,000. Exported
        CSV files can be opened in a spreadsheet application for manipulation. The
        organizations REST API also provides access to audit log activities for export
        and saving. There are also third-party apps, such as 'Exporter for Jira',
        that allow exporting more than 1000 issues with comments, attachments, and
        transitions to Excel, CSV, and PDF for migrations, audits, and reports. [1,

        centralized visibility into user activity, including account management. [9,
        16, 22, 36]
    user_login:
      reference: https://support.atlassian.com/jira/kb/how-to-analyze-the-atlassian-jira-securitylog-file/
      value: User login and session events are captured in the `atlassian-jira-security.log`
        file. These logs can help identify compromised accounts, login issues, and
        403 status codes from the REST API. The logs include information such as the
        unique Atlassian Session ID, IP address, and location. This audit log feature
        is available only for Jira paid accounts (Premium or above), not for free
        plans. [1, 13, 32, 38]
  event_logs_licensing_level:

      Functions to pull logs. [3, 8, 18]
  - reference: https://support.atlassian.com/jira-service-management-cloud/docs/integrate-with-splunk/
    value: Splunk offers integration with Jira Service Management for two-way communication.
      There's a 'Jira Service Management App from Splunkbase' for configuration. Splunk
      On-Call has an add-on for Jira that allows creating Splunk On-Call incidents
      when new issues are added to Jira tickets. The 'Real-Time Splunk for Jira Service
      Desk' plugin can automate turning Splunk events into Jira Service Desk tickets.
      [6, 7, 17, 28, 30]
  - reference: https://www.datadoghq.com/blog/datadog-cloud-siem-atlassian/
    value: Datadog Cloud SIEM integrates with Atlassian Jira and Confluence Audit
      Records and Atlassian Organization Audit Logs. These integrations collect and
      process audit logs covering activities like account management, system configuration,
      and product access changes, enabling visualization, metrics, and alerts. [9]
  - reference: https://cloud.google.com/chronicle/docs/ingestion/default-parsers/atlassian-jira
    value: Google Security Operations can collect Atlassian Jira logs in SYSLOG and
      JSON formats using a parser that extracts various fields and maps them to the

  invalidate_sessions_api:
    reference: https://support.atlassian.com/jira/kb/invalidating-user-sessions-in-jira-data-center/
    value: Jira Data Center (version 9.11 and later) allows instant invalidation of
      a particular user session across all nodes via a REST API DELETE request to
      `/api/2/user/session/{username}`. Prior to Jira 9.11, instant user session invalidation
      in a multinode environment was not possible. Changing a user's password also
      clears their sessions and 'remember me' cookies from the database. A rolling
      restart of all nodes can invalidate all user sessions in a multinode Jira Data
      Center by deleting 'remember me' tokens from the database.
  known_automation_tools:
  - reference: https://support.atlassian.com/jira-service-management-cloud/docs/automate-incident-management-in-jira-service-management/
    value: 'Jira Automation: Allows defining rules to respond to changes in incident
      work items. Triggers can be based on events like incident creation or escalation,
      with conditions based on priority or impacted services. Actions include adding
      bookmarks, members, or apps to Slack channels, and sending messages. It can
      also be used to create post-incident reviews automatically.'

      API. Requires an Atlassian API token.'
  revoke_api_key_api:
    reference: https://support.atlassian.com/atlassian-account/docs/manage-api-tokens-for-your-atlassian-account/
    value: Atlassian allows users to revoke individual API tokens or all API tokens
      for their account through the security settings in their Atlassian account profile.
      This action permanently removes the token. It is also possible to automate this
      process using the Delete API token API.
  session_timeout_configuration:
    reference: https://support.atlassian.com/jira/kb/how-to-change-the-default-session-timeout-to-avoid-user-logout-in-jira-data-center/
    value: For Jira Data Center, the idle session timeout can be configured by editing
      the `web.xml` file in `<jira-install>/atlassian-jira/WEB-INF/` and adjusting
      the `<session-timeout>` value in minutes. Additionally, the `max-age` for the
      JSESSIONID cookie can be configured in `<jira-install>/conf/web.xml`, which
      is set in seconds. There is also a `seraph.rememberme.cookie` with a default
      `max-age` of 14 days. For Jira Cloud, the expiration period for a session can
      be configured, and there is documentation available on 'Session duration management'.
  suspend_user_api:
    reference: hallucinated link doublecheck content
    value: Uncertain. While Atlassian provides ways to manage user access and delete
      users, there is no direct evidence of a specific API endpoint to 'suspend' a
      user that would prevent login while retaining their data and configuration.
      Actions like changing a user's password or anonymizing/deleting a user can affect
      their session and access.
  user_status_api:
    reference: https://www.datadoghq.com/blog/datadog-cloud-siem-atlassian/
    value: Uncertain. While Jira's audit logs can capture user account management
      activities and SIEM integrations can provide visibility into authentication
      and authorization events, a dedicated API to programmatically query the active/suspended/disabled
      status of users was not explicitly found in the search results.
  user_toggle_api:
    reference: hallucinated link doublecheck content
    value: Uncertain. While session invalidation is possible through API (as described
      in invalidate_sessions_api), there is no explicit API documentation found that
      describes a programmatic 'toggle' of a user's status (active/suspended/disabled)
      that would directly control their login ability and simultaneously invalidate
      sessions as a single operation. Changing a user's password or deleting a user
      can impact their active sessions.
