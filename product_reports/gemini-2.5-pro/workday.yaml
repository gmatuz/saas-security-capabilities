  event_logs:
    api_call:
      reference: https://docs.hunters.ai/docs/workday
      value: Workday provides an 'API Activity' dashboard that gives insight into
        analytics for REST API calls and web service related authentications, monitoring
        access attempts and identifying requests from malicious IP addresses. Workday
        Activity Logs also capture API calls.
    configuration_change:
      reference: https://help.sumologic.com/docs/integrations/saas-cloud/workday/
      value: Workday captures configuration changes, including those related to domain
        security, business processes, security groups, and API client modules. The
        'Workday - System User Activity' dashboard in Sumo Logic is designed to monitor
        these changes and help determine if they align with expectations.
    data_export:
      reference: hallucinated link doublecheck content
      value: Workday provides the capability to export data using Simple or SQL views.
        These exports can be created after setting up a connection to Workday. Audit
        logs specifically for requisitions and candidates can be exported to Excel.
    role_assignment:
      reference: https://help.sumologic.com/docs/integrations/saas-cloud/workday/
      value: Workday allows monitoring of configuration changes related to security
        groups, which would include role assignments. The 'Workday - System User Activity'
        dashboard in Sumo Logic helps identify changes related to permission and role
        assignments.
    security_policy_change:
      reference: https://soais.com/audits-in-workday-hcm/
      value: Workday provides exception audit reports that can identify problems with
        security policies and security groups. This suggests that changes to security
        policies are logged and auditable.
    user_account_creation:
      reference: https://soais.com/audits-in-workday-hcm/
      value: Workday provides audit trails for every change made, including who made
        the change and when. This capability would logically extend to user account
        creation for administrative users, as it tracks new values and the person
        who made the change.
    user_login:
      reference: https://help.sumologic.com/docs/integrations/saas-cloud/workday/
      value: Workday provides 'SignOn Logs' which are in JSON format and offer insights
        into user activity including who is making requests, what type of requests
        are being made, the total amount of requests, device type, and IP address.
        These logs are part of the 'User Activity Logs'. The 'Workday - Overview'
        dashboard in Sumo Logic also identifies login activity and failed logins.
  event_logs_licensing_level:
    reference: hallucinated link doublecheck content
    value: To access Workday user activity logs for integration, User Activity Logging
      needs to be enabled at the tenant level and OAuth 2.0 Clients need to be enabled.
      An Integration System User (ISU) with specific security group permissions (e.g.,
      'System Auditing' domain with 'View' and 'Get' access) and an API client for
      integrations with a 'System' scope are required. There is no explicit mention
      of additional licensing beyond standard Workday access and configuration for
      these features.
  ingestion_methods:
  - reference: https://docs.rapid7.com/insightidr/workday/
    value: Workday logs can be ingested via API, specifically the User Activity Logging
      API. This is the primary method for SIEM integrations.
  - reference: https://growrk.com/blog/workday-integrations
    value: Workday also offers pre-built integration packages and connectors for third-party
      systems.
  log_export_options:
    tools_connectors:
      reference: https://docs.rapid7.com/insightidr/workday/
      value: Workday supports log export primarily through its APIs (REST and SOAP).
        OAuth 2.0 is the recommended authentication method for API access. Integrations
        can be configured to use API clients for pulling data. Additionally, individual
        audit trails for specific items like candidate or requisition data can be
        exported to Excel files from the Workday UI.

  invalidate_sessions_api:
    reference: https://workday.yale.edu/sites/default/files/files/workday-mobile-security-faq.pdf
    value: Uncertain. Workday sessions can be configured with timeouts [3, 4, 5, 6].
      However, direct API calls to invalidate individual user sessions programmatically
      were not explicitly identified. The general approach to session management involves
      setting timeout durations rather than direct invalidation APIs. [3, 4, 5, 6]
  known_automation_tools:
  - reference: https://www.workday.com/content/dam/web/uk/documents/datasheets/datasheet-workday-integration-cloud-platform-uk.pdf
    value: Workday Integration Cloud Platform (iPaaS) provides tools like Enterprise
      Interface Builder (EIB) for low-code/no-code integrations and Workday Studio
      for sophisticated customizations, enabling automation of processes to and from
      Workday. [20, 23]
  - reference: https://appomni.com/workday/
    value: AppOmni is a commercial solution that integrates with Workday to provide
      deep posture inspection, privilege configuration, threat detection, and the
      ability to export normalized logs for further analysis with SIEM/SOAR for quick
      action. [18]
  - reference: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/security/business/microsoft-sentinel
    value: Microsoft Sentinel is listed as a SOAR platform that integrates with Workday
      Extend. [9]
  - reference: https://github.com/ubangura/Workday-Application-Automator
    value: There is a GitHub repository "ubangura/Workday-Application-Automator" which
      is a Workday Application Automator using Puppeteer. [14] This is described as
      a simple extension to prevent session timeouts on the Workday website and automates
      application tasks. [8, 14]
  revoke_api_key_api:
    reference: https://docs.rapid7.com/insightidr/workday/
    value: Uncertain. Workday utilizes OAuth for API authentication, particularly
      the API Client for Integrations method for refreshable access tokens. [13] While
      Workday allows for the setup of integration security system groups and OAuth
      authentication, explicit API endpoints or methods for programmatically revoking
      specific API keys or personal tokens were not found in the search results. [13]
  session_timeout_configuration:
    reference: https://www.reco.ai/hub/effective-session-management-policies-workday
    value: Workday allows for configurable session timeouts, which can be set at the
      tenant level or for individual users. [3, 4, 5] The default session timeout
      can be 20 minutes, with some organizations extending it to 30 minutes or even
      90 minutes. [3, 4, 6, 26] There is also mention of a default value of 0 minutes,
      which prevents sessions from timing out prematurely. [1, 2, 7] The "Maintain
      Password Rules" task modifies the tenant's default session timeout, and the
      "Edit Workday Account" task can adjust an individual user's session timeout.
      [4] Some specific roles may have a shorter 15-minute timeout for compliance
      reasons. [6]
  suspend_user_api:
    reference: https://learn.microsoft.com/pt-br/entra/identity/saas-apps/workday-inbound-tutorial
    value: Uncertain. While Workday allows for user provisioning and de-provisioning
      through integrations like Microsoft Entra ID, explicit API endpoints for programmatic
      user suspension were not found. The process often involves configuring provisioning
      applications within Workday that can manage user accounts. [1, 2, 7]
  user_status_api:
    reference: hallucinated link doublecheck content
    value: Uncertain. While Workday's provisioning capabilities with Microsoft Entra
      ID suggest managing user accounts and their states (e.g., active), a direct
      API specifically for querying the login status (active vs. suspended/disabled/non-existent)
      of Workday users was not explicitly detailed. [1, 2, 7]
  user_toggle_api:
    reference: hallucinated link doublecheck content
    value: Uncertain. Workday allows for user provisioning with systems like Microsoft
      Entra ID, which can involve managing user accounts. [1, 2, 7] However, a specific
      API for toggling user status (e.g., active to suspended/disabled and vice-versa)
      and its immediate impact on active sessions was not clearly identified. The
      information suggests managing user accounts through provisioning, which might
      imply status changes. [1, 2, 7]
