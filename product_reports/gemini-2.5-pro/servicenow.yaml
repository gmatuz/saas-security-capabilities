  event_logs:
    api_call:
      reference: https://www.reco.ai/hub/enhancing-api-security-practices-in-servicenow
      value: ServiceNow enables comprehensive audit logging for API usage, including
        authentication attempts, authorization failures, and access to sensitive resources.
        REST APIs in ServiceNow use basic authentication or OAuth by default, and
        can be configured with multi-factor authentication. [17] The user ID specified
        in a REST endpoint call is subject to access control. [17]
    configuration_change:
      reference: hallucinated link doublecheck content
      value: Configuration changes are available on the sys_update_xml table. [14]
        The sys_audit table tracks every single change made to records in tables.
        [34]
    data_export:
      reference: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=5b_ABuwT8dM
      value: The Log Export Service (LES) can export data from audit tables and application
        node log files. [33] This allows for auditing of specific operations happening
        on a table. [33] ServiceNow also mentions 'data export actions' in relation
        to security monitoring scenarios. [6]
    role_assignment:
      reference: https://vertexaisearch.cloud.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQHBXs8y6QD-avQ7dEDUH3hcGkPcy-K8fNi3aIxGAhhixjWc34vc4_vS8hMq7cX9jBleE21IWj9B5f11q96XeL-yPq4BoJLI_ZOHffy4pRrZynuNoNLZs1Fb8bvBtRIMNPNSB983Ipk0VVnCPC_CSSf9VBkwcKKhROe7UCCsT_Pm2C-FCJrxy39XvdatifRnZqezMX2WJw8L-vAA1D2lxPQ3GbTWb0ZGlaT_AmCz8KThBae5oQ==
      value: Uncertain. While there is mention of 'permission changes' being extracted
        by parsers for security event data [25], and 'role-based access control for
        data security' as a feature of ServiceNow Security Operations, specific audit
        logs for role assignment with schema details were not found. [37]
    security_policy_change:
      reference: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-OpTuG8DvY
      value: ServiceNow can automate security policy building on devices like Palo
        Alto Panorama using Flow Designer. [29] This involves making REST API calls
        to the device based on catalog item requests. [29] The platform is also fully
        integrated with the MITRE ATT&CK framework for threat intelligence, which
        can provide insights into defensive systems' performance and identify gaps.

      reference: https://www.servicenow.com:443/community/servicenow-ai-platform-forum/user-activity-log/m-p/1091400
      value: ServiceNow's Security Operations (SecOps) licensing helps companies automate
        security incident response and vulnerability management, which includes user
        and entity behavior analytics (UEBA). [7], [13] Google SecOps parser for ServiceNow
        security logs handles various event types like logins and 'permission changes',
        populating principal/target user information. [25] A discussion in the ServiceNow
        Community mentioned extracting security logs into SIEM tools when a user is
        renamed, disabled, or enabled, implying logs related to user account changes.
        [10]
    user_login:
      reference: hallucinated link doublecheck content
      value: ServiceNow logs authentication successes and failures. These can be reviewed
        for security purposes. [14]

    reference: https://www.cloudnuro.ai/blog/understanding-servicenow-licensing-a-comprehensive-guide
    value: ServiceNow's Security Operations (SecOps) is a licensed product. [7], [15],
      [36] Access to the Log Export Service (LES) is included with a ServiceNow Vault
      license, allowing for unlimited data export. [33] Security Incident Response
      and Event Management for Security Operations are also mentioned as included
      applications within Security Operations Professional licensing. [31] Pricing
      for Security Operations is custom and requires contacting ServiceNow sales.

        of system and application logs from various tables (syslog, sys_audit, transaction,
        application node log files) to external analytics tools like Splunk or Kafka-based
        consumers. [33], [34] Integrations can also be built using the REST API to
        send data from ServiceNow to SIEMs [12] or for security policy automation.

  invalidate_sessions_api:
    reference: https://www.servicenow.com/community/itsm-forum/invalidate-timeout-user-session/td-p/858264
    value: Uncertain. While session timeout configurations exist, there is no explicit
      mention of an API to programmatically invalidate all or specific active user
      sessions.
  known_automation_tools:
  - reference: https://securityboulevard.com/2023/11/automated-incident-response-with-servicenow-and-smart-soar/

      Google SecOps (Chronicle SOAR), Cortex XSOAR (Palo Alto), Securonix SOAR, SIRP,
      Rapid7 InsightConnect, and Microsoft Sentinel to automate tasks such as ticket
      creation, incident management, and request handling, including bi-directional
      synchronization of incident updates.

    value: ServiceNow's Flow Designer allows for building automated workflows, including
      triggering incident creation from inbound emails and attaching relevant files
      without requiring code.
  - reference: https://metronlabs.com/servicenow
    value: ServiceNow provides REST APIs for integrating with external systems, allowing
      data insertion and manipulation (create, update, retrieve, delete) across various
      ServiceNow tables. OAuth authentication is supported.
  - reference: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d79u5AEkuIE
    value: Robotic Process Automation (RPA) tools like Automation Anywhere can be

      allows for automated incident creation, intelligent routing, anomaly detection,
      and root cause analysis.
  revoke_api_key_api:
    reference: https://qualityclouds.com/documentation/qc/administering-account/transition-from-api-key-to-auth-token-in-servicenow/
    value: Uncertain. Although ServiceNow provides REST APIs for integration and data
      ingestion, no specific API for programmatically revoking API keys (personal
      or global) for ServiceNow users is detailed in the search results.
  session_timeout_configuration:
    reference: https://thesnowball.co/how-to-manage-session-timeout-system-properties-in-servicenow/
    value: ServiceNow allows configuring session timeouts through the `glide.ui.session_timeout`
      system property. The default inactive session timeout for authenticated and
      guest users is 30 minutes. ServiceNow recommends a 60-minute timeout but advises
      against exceeding one day (1440 minutes) due to security risks. Inactivity is
      defined by a lack of server-side interaction.
  suspend_user_api:
    reference: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/60658887/servicenow-api-how-to-get-all-users-and-all-their-attributes
    value: Uncertain. There is no explicit documentation found regarding a direct
      programmatic API to suspend users within ServiceNow as a business user of the
      platform. The focus is on incident workflow orchestration and integrations that
      may enable user management in external systems.
  user_status_api:
    reference: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/60658887/servicenow-api-how-to-get-all-users-and-all-their-attributes
    value: Uncertain. While user details can be retrieved through integrations, a
      specific API for querying the active, suspended, or disabled status of ServiceNow
      users for internal security purposes is not explicitly detailed.
  user_toggle_api:
    reference: hallucinated link doublecheck content
    value: Uncertain. No direct API to toggle user statuses (active/suspended/disabled)
      for ServiceNow users as a primary incident response action within ServiceNow
      itself is described, nor whether such a toggle automatically disables active
      sessions.
