incident_response:
  suspend_user_management_api:
    value: "Yes, via two methods. 1) SCIM: Unassigning a user in a connected identity provider (Okta, Azure AD) deactivates their Grammarly account. 2) License Management API: The `DELETE /ecosystem/api/v1/users/{user_id}` endpoint programmatically removes a user from the subscription."
    reference: "https://developer.grammarly.com/docs/api/license-management-api/Users/remove-user"
  invalidate_sessions_api:
    value: "Yes, this is an implicit function of deactivating a user via SCIM. The documentation states that when access is unassigned, the identity provider communicates with Grammarly to 'invalidate any authenticated sessions and deactivate the member's account'."

  revoke_api_key_api:

    reference: "https://developer.grammarly.com/docs/api/rest-api/getting-started"

  user_status_api:
    value: "Yes, via the License Management API. The endpoint `GET /ecosystem/api/v1/users` retrieves a list of users and includes their `last_activity_at` timestamp, which can be used to check for inactivity or status."
    reference: "https://developer.grammarly.com/docs/api/license-management-api/Users/list-users"
  session_timeout_configuration:
