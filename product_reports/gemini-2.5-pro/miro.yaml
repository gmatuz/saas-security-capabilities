      new access tokens.'
  user_management_api_authentication_mechanisms:
    reference: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2vqZK4qPcno
    value: The Miro SCIM API uses an API Token for authentication. The Miro REST API

  - https://developers.miro.com/reference/audit-logs
  event_logs:
    api_call:
      reference: hallucinated link doublecheck content
      value: Audit logs are accessible via the Audit Log API. The Miro app for IBM
        QRadar uses the Audit Logs API to fetch Miro Enterprise audit logs, confirming
        API calls are logged. The Sumo Logic Miro Source API integration ingests audit
        logs obtained from the Audit log API.
    configuration_change:
      reference: https://help.miro.com/hc/en-us/articles/360017571434-Audit-logs
      value: Audit logs are useful for tracking important events such as changes to
        global security settings. Microsoft Sentinel's Audit events normalization
        schema also defines how audit events, including system configuration activities
        and policy changes, are represented.
    data_export:
      reference: hallucinated link doublecheck content
      value: Miro's audit logs can capture 'data export actions'. Audit logs can be
        exported in CSV file format. Additionally, Content Logs, available for Enterprise
        Guard customers, allow for collecting detailed records of user activity on
        boards for investigations and regulatory archival, and can be accessed via
        the Content logs API or supported integrations like Smarsh or Theta Lake.
    role_assignment:
      reference: https://help.miro.com/hc/en-us/articles/360017571434-Audit-logs
      value: Miro's audit logs track changes to global security settings and new user
        invitations, which can imply role assignment changes. While explicit 'role
        assignment' events are not detailed with schema, the presence of these related
        events suggests that such changes would be logged.
    security_policy_change:
      reference: https://vertexaisearch.google.com/grounding-api-redirect/AUZIYQEV6t-ck3mJgfEBCRy5ppuKaidj6uem6LjUcWBubCFXQ1gMXO_EYsHgoxR310GSSk0FRWT12kqe1GdN_mnYWJytSPVy1IhKH6MT-fSmDjfUu3xQRQeymf4vydEYQEefNcdlclchLPgRJ8epScPjQnFGT2X1-4MU4eHz
      value: Audit logs are useful for tracking changes to global security settings.
        This includes actions like enabling/disabling SSO/SAML settings, SCIM, allowlist,
        sharing with guests, public link sharing, and domain control settings. [8,
        9]
    user_account_creation:
      reference: https://help.sumologic.com/docs/integrations/saas-cloud/miro/
      value: Miro's audit logs track new user invitations. The Sumo Logic app for
        Miro provides widgets for 'Account(s) Created' and 'Account(s) Deleted', 'User(s)
        Deactivated', and 'User(s) Reactivated'.
    user_login:
      reference: https://help.sumologic.com/docs/integrations/saas-cloud/miro/
      value: Miro's audit logs capture user and system-level activity, including logins.
        The Sumo Logic app for Miro specifically tracks 'Sign-in Security Events'
        and 'Sign-in over time by Authentication Methods', and highlights 'Sign-in
        from Risky Geo-Locations'.
  event_logs_licensing_level:
    reference: hallucinated link doublecheck content
    value: Miro's SIEM integration for audit logs is available for Enterprise subscriptions.
      The Miro App for Splunk states that Audit Logs are available to all Enterprise
      accounts. Content Logs require Miro Enterprise Guard customers. To collect audit
      logs using the Miro Source API integration, a Miro Enterprise account is required.
  ingestion_methods:
  - reference: https://help.sumologic.com/docs/integrations/saas-cloud/miro/
    value: Sumo Logic uses a cloud-to-cloud source connector for Miro audit logs,
      with a polling interval of 5 minutes.
  - reference: https://developers.miro.com/docs/getting-started-with-webhooks
    value: Miro also offers a Webhooks API for real-time event notifications.

        Company Settings. Additionally, access to audit logs and content logs is available
        via their respective APIs.
  monitoring_products:
  - reference: https://help.sumologic.com/docs/integrations/saas-cloud/miro/
    value: The Sumo Logic app for Miro provides visibility into Miro audit logs, leveraging
      the Miro cloud-to-cloud source to collect audit log data. It includes pre-built
      dashboards for security events and user activity.

  invalidate_sessions_api:
    reference: hallucinated link doublecheck content
    value: While there isn't a direct API specifically for invalidating all active
      sessions for a user, Miro's session idle timeout functionality automatically
      logs users off their Miro profile if their session hits the configured inactivity
      limit, requiring re-authentication. This feature is available for Enterprise
      plans. If a user belongs to multiple organizations with different idle session
      timeout intervals, the shortest duration prevails for all active sessions.
  known_automation_tools:
  - reference: https://zapier.com/apps/incidentio/integrations/miro
    value: Miro can be integrated with Zapier to automate workflows, including connecting
      with incident management tools like incident.io. Zapier can automate actions
      such as creating Miro widgets from new Trello cards or handling lead management.
  - reference: https://miroapp.github.io/api-clients/node/index.html
    value: Miro's Developer Platform allows for custom integrations and programmatic
      data exchange with external systems using its REST APIs and Node.js client library.
      The SCIM API enables automated user provisioning and management.
  - reference: https://www.infoq.com/news/2022/09/observability-incident-mgmt-miro/
    value: Miro's data engineering team has systematized alerts and incident management
      using OpsGenie as their incident management platform for on-call schedules and
      overrides.
  - reference: https://docs.n8n.io/
    value: The n8n automation platform lists Miro as an integration with available
      Miro credentials.
  revoke_api_key_api:
    reference: https://developers.miro.com/docs/revoke-token-v2
    value: Miro provides an API endpoint to revoke access tokens. When an access token
      is revoked, the associated refresh token is also revoked and becomes invalid.
      This action does not uninstall the application for the user. There is a v2 endpoint
      available, and a v1 endpoint is deprecated due to security concerns regarding
      passing the token publicly in the URL.
  session_timeout_configuration:
    reference: hallucinated link doublecheck content
    value: Miro's Enterprise plan offers an "Idle Session Timeout" feature that allows
      administrators to set a limit on how long end-users can be inactive before being
      automatically logged off. The duration can be customized from a minimum of 1
      hour to a maximum of 14 days, with Miro recommending a duration of no less than
      8 hours. This setting affects all members and guests. This feature is managed
      through the Company settings > Security > Authentication section in the Admin
      console.
  suspend_user_api:
    reference: https://developers.miro.com/docs/users
    value: Miro's SCIM API allows for managing users in an Enterprise account, including
      the ability to activate or deactivate users. This implies the ability to suspend
      a user by deactivating their account.
  user_status_api:
    reference: https://developers.miro.com/docs/users
    value: Miro's SCIM API allows for getting the full list of users and filtering
      by attributes, including the ability to activate or deactivate users. This implies
      that the user status (active/inactive) can be retrieved.
  user_toggle_api:
    reference: https://developers.miro.com/docs/users
    value: Miro's SCIM API allows for activating or deactivating users. While not
      explicitly stated as "toggling," deactivation would effectively suspend a user's
      ability to log in. It's uncertain if deactivating a user via SCIM API would
      immediately disable active sessions without an explicit "invalidate sessions"
      API.
