    value: yes - Role assignment can be managed via SCIM, particularly for user licenses
      on the Enterprise plan. Okta integration for SCIM can manage groups, and changes
      are reflected in Figma.
  rbac_support:
    reference: https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360039970673-Team-permissions
    value: yes - Figma supports various admin roles (Team admins, Workspace admins,
      Billing group admins, Organization admins) with different permissions. Team
      admins manage members and permissions for their team. Organization admins can
      adjust login and provisioning settings (including SAML SSO and SCIM), manage
      seats, remove people, and control access to products and features. Workspace
      admins and Billing group admins have more limited roles, primarily for managing
      workspaces and billing groups respectively.

    suspended_disabled:
      reference: https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360048787534-Manage-seats-via-SCIM
      value: uncertain - The search results indicate that SCIM on the Enterprise plan
        allows for setting seat types and managing billing status, implying control
        over whether suspended/disabled users incur costs, but it doesn't explicitly
        state if they always do or don't. A Reddit discussion suggests managing licenses
        via custom attributes when using Okta for provisioning, implying potential
        for fine-grained control over which users are assigned paid seats.

      (for enterprise plan activity log tracking).
  user_management_api_licensing_level:
    reference: hallucinated link doublecheck content
    value: Uncertain for non-SCIM user management API. SCIM provisioning and management
      of user licenses through SCIM API are available on the Organization and Enterprise
      plans, with seat type management being Enterprise-only. Personal Access Tokens
      can be generated on any account, but their utility for general user management
      outside of SCIM for business users is unclear from the search results.
  user_management_api_support:
    reference: https://figma-gov.com/developers/api
    value: yes - Figma provides a SCIM API for user and group management. Additionally,
      Personal Access Tokens can be used to grant access to Figma API for third-party
      integrations, although it's noted they allow access to all files and data without
      restriction.

      value: The Figma API includes endpoints to manage user lifecycle, leveraging
        SCIM endpoints. These allow for creating new objects, overwriting objects,
        modifying objects, and removing objects. [10]
    user_login:
      reference: https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360040449533-View-and-export-activity-logs
      value: Figma's activity logs track when members and guests access organization
        files and resources. However, Figma does not record login events for guests
        of the organization, nor does it track when a member closes a browser window
        or exits Figma without logging out. [2]
  event_logs_licensing_level:
    reference: https://figmareleases.blogspot.com/2022/10/activity-logs-api.html

  revoke_api_key_api:
    reference: https://forum.figma.com/ask-the-community-7/how-to-revoke-an-oauth-token-from-my-app-20892
    value: Figma provides the ability to revoke personal access tokens through the
      UI. [2, 12] Revocations are instant. [2] OAuth tokens also expire by default
      after 90 days and require refreshing with a refresh token. [2] A user can revoke
      an OAuth token previously granted to a Figma application, and this action is
      captured in the activity log. [2] While the UI allows revocation, specific API
      endpoints for programmatically revoking personal access tokens or OAuth tokens
      were not explicitly found in the developer documentation. An issue related to
      revoking OAuth tokens from an app via a POST request returning a 404 error was
      found in the Figma forum. [40]
  session_timeout_configuration:
    reference: hallucinated link doublecheck content
    value: Figma allows organization admins on the Enterprise plan to set an idle
      session timeout from 12 hours to 14 days. By default, it's 21 days. This feature
      logs inactive users out across all platforms. Figma's activity log captures
      changes to this policy and when members are logged out due to a timeout. [1]
  suspend_user_api:
    reference: hallucinated link doublecheck content
    value: Uncertain. Figma offers a SCIM 2.0 API that can be used to remove users
      from an organization, which instantly frees the seat, logs the user out, and
      blocks their access to all teams, projects, and files. This is equivalent to
      suspending a user. [20]
  user_status_api:
    reference: https://www.figma.com/developers/api
    value: No evidence. The Figma API supports read access to files, images, file
      versions, users, comments, team projects and project files. [2] However, specific
      API endpoints for querying user status (active, suspended, disabled) were not
      found in the available documentation.
  user_toggle_api:
    reference: hallucinated link doublecheck content
    value: Uncertain. Figma's SCIM 2.0 API can remove users from an organization,
      which logs them out and blocks access. [20] This acts as a disable function.
      There is no explicit mention of an API to simply "toggle" a user's active/suspended
      status while retaining their account within the organization.
