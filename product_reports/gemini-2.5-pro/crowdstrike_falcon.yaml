    reference: https://www.falconpy.io/Service-Collections/User-Management.html
    value: CrowdStrike Falcon allows for user creation, modification (first/last name),
      and permanent deletion via API. Roles can be assigned and revoked. User invitation
      is also a supported method through the console. Specific 'suspended' or 'archived'
      states for user accounts were not explicitly detailed beyond general deactivation/deletion.
  rbac_api_assignment:
    reference: https://www.falconpy.io/Service-Collections/User-Management.html
    value: yes - Roles and rights can be assigned and revoked through the CrowdStrike
      Falcon API. The FalconPy SDK provides operations like `GrantUserRoleIds` and
      `RevokeUserRoleIds` for this purpose.
  rbac_support:
    reference: https://inventivehq.com/knowledge-base/crowdstrike/creating-and-managing-user-roles-in-crowdstrike-falcon/
    value: yes - CrowdStrike Falcon allows administrators to assign custom roles and
      permissions to users, ensuring least privilege access and role-based security
      management. Predefined roles such as Administrator, Analyst, Investigator, Responder,
      and Sensor Manager are available, and custom roles can be created with specific
      permissions (Read-Only, Standard, Full Access).
  scim_authentication_acquisition_steps:
    reference: https://shuffler.io/apps/CrowdStrike/integrations/Feed_API
    value: uncertain - No explicit steps found for acquiring SCIM V2 credentials.
      For general API access, an API client with appropriate scopes (including 'User
      management') needs to be created in the Falcon UI by a Falcon Administrator.
      This generates a client ID and client secret.
  scim_authentication_mechanisms:
    reference: https://shuffler.io/apps/CrowdStrike/integrations/Feed_API
    value: uncertain - No explicit information found regarding SCIM-specific authentication
      mechanisms. However, general API authentication for CrowdStrike Falcon uses
      OAuth2 with client ID and client secret.

  event_logs:
    api_call:
      reference: https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/tech-center/get-access-falcon-apis/
      value: CrowdStrike Falcon logs endpoint activity, and the Falcon SIEM Connector
        can be configured using Falcon API credentials. [1, 3] This implies that API
        calls to the Falcon platform itself, made via generated API keys, are a source
        of logs. When integrating with SIEMs like Google Security Operations, creating
        API client key pairs with specific permissions like 'READ' for 'Event Streams',
        'Detections', and 'Alerts' is a prerequisite, indicating that interactions
        with the CrowdStrike API are part of the log collection process. [4, 6, 7,
        8, 34]
    configuration_change:
      reference: hallucinated link doublecheck content
      value: The documentation mentions 'system changes' as part of system logs (syslog)
        generally. [37] While not explicitly detailing configuration changes within
        the CrowdStrike Falcon platform itself, the general nature of system logs
        often includes such events. No specific schema or explicit confirmation of
        CrowdStrike Falcon's internal configuration changes being logged was found.
    data_export:
      reference: hallucinated link doublecheck content
      value: CrowdStrike Falcon Data Replicator (FDR) allows replication of log data
        from the CrowdStrike environment to an S3 bucket for bulk data export. [23,
        42] Mindflow can export relevant log data from Falcon LogScale for external
        auditing processes. [14]
    role_assignment:
      reference: hallucinated link doublecheck content
      value: CrowdStrike Falcon Next-Gen SIEM can highlight suspicious activity, such
        as when an Okta admin role is assigned to a user or group, through out-of-the-box
        correlation rules. This indicates that role assignment changes can be logged
        and analyzed. [40]
    security_policy_change:
      reference: hallucinated link doublecheck content
      value: Uncertain. While CrowdStrike Falcon LogScale enhances observability and
        helps with security insights, and the platform has features like firewall
        control and device control, explicit documentation detailing audit logs for
        changes to security policies within the CrowdStrike Falcon platform was not
        found. [9, 14]
    user_account_creation:
      reference: hallucinated link doublecheck content
      value: Uncertain. While user login and role assignment events are mentioned
        as being ingestible for SIEM purposes through CrowdStrike's Next-Gen SIEM,
        specific details about logs for user account creation within the CrowdStrike
        Falcon platform were not explicitly found in the search results.
    user_login:
      reference: hallucinated link doublecheck content
      value: CrowdStrike Falcon can ingest user events such as logins, authentication
        attempts, MFA challenges, and account lockouts, particularly from third-party
