    value: While not specific to Adobe Acrobat, Adobe states that they leverage industry-standard
      SOAR platforms to optimize the handling of vulnerabilities, alerts, and events
      at scale for their own incident response program. This suggests that Adobe products,
      in general, might be compatible with SOAR integrations, though specific Adobe
      Acrobat integrations are not detailed.

      suspend users in Adobe Acrobat. However, Adobe does offer APIs for Adobe Document
      Services to automate PDF workflows, and Adobe Acrobat Sign offers APIs for integrating
      e-signature workflows with enterprise systems, which might include user management
      functionalities within a broader context.
  user_status_api:
    reference: https://rollout.com/integration-guides/adobe-sign/api-essentials
    value: Uncertain. No specific API was found that allows checking user status (active,
      suspended, disabled, non-existent) for Adobe Acrobat users.
  user_toggle_api:
    reference: hallucinated link doublecheck content
    value: Uncertain. No information was found regarding an API to toggle user status
      (active/suspended/disabled) that would also affect active sessions in Adobe
      Acrobat.
