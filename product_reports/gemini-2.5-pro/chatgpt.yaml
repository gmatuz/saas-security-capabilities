identity_and_access:
  scim_authentication_acquisition_steps:
    reference: hallucinated link doublecheck content
    value: SCIM integration setup for ChatGPT Enterprise is enabled by ChatGPT users
      with Owner access in the Identity and Provisioning tab, guiding them through
      the WorkOS portal. For example, when integrating with Okta, the process involves
      configuring SAML in OpenAI by accessing the Identity & Provisioning settings
      in the ChatGPT workspace, adding SAML SSO, and pasting the SSO URL and X.509
      Signing Certificate from the IdP.
  scim_authentication_mechanisms:
    reference: https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui
    value: Uncertain. While SCIM supports integration with various IDPs, specific
      authentication mechanisms (e.g., OAuth, API keys, Basic Auth) for the SCIM endpoint
      are not explicitly detailed in the provided documentation for ChatGPT. For Okta
      SCIM integration, common methods include Basic Auth with username/password or
      HTTP Header with a bearer token.
  scim_licensing_level_requirement:
    reference: https://blockchain.news/news/openai-introduces-new-compliance-administrative-tools-chatgpt-enterprise
    value: SCIM support is available for ChatGPT Enterprise.
  scim_support:
    reference: hallucinated link doublecheck content
    value: yes - SCIM (System for Cross-domain Identity Management) v2 is supported
      for automated provisioning and deprovisioning of user accounts in ChatGPT Enterprise.
      It is currently in beta with broader availability. It supports Okta, Entra ID
      (Azure AD), Google Workspace, PingFederate, OneLogin, Rippling, and custom SCIM
      implementations, as well as SFTP endpoint for CSV file provisioning. Group syncing
      via SCIM is also supported.
  sso_license_level_requirement:
    reference: https://help.openai.com/en/articles/9534785-configuring-sso-for-chatgpt
    value: Team, Enterprise, or Edu ChatGPT Workspace are required for SSO setup.
      For API Platform, a Custom/Enterprise Billing Plan is necessary.
  sso_support:
    reference: https://help.openai.com/en/articles/9534785-configuring-sso-for-chatgpt
    value: yes - SAML authentication for ChatGPT Enterprise and API Platform, supporting
      IdPs like Okta, Azure Active Directory/Entra ID, and Google Workspace. Both
      SP-Initiated and IdP-Initiated logins are supported. Social login via Google,
      Microsoft, and Apple is also supported for non-enforced SSO scenarios.
  user_management_api_support:
    value: yes - ChatGPT Enterprise offers an admin console with bulk member management.
      While a distinct 'user management API' (separate from SCIM) isn't explicitly
      detailed with endpoints, the OpenAI API supports API keys for authentication
      and allows sending requests to OpenAI's models, which implies programmatic interaction
      capabilities. The SCIM integration itself provides automated provisioning and
      deprovisioning, acting as a user management API.

      value: The Enterprise Compliance API allows workspace owners to audit and manage
        their ChatGPT Enterprise workspace data efficiently, including detailed records
        of time-stamped interactions and uploaded files. [2] Microsoft Purview can
        scan ChatGPT Enterprise workspaces to identify messages and supports extracting
        technical metadata, including text prompts and responses. [27] Palo Alto Networks
        integration with ChatGPT Enterprise provides visibility into sensitive data,
        including conversations and metadata used to build custom GPTs, allowing identification
        of potential data exposure risks. [25]
