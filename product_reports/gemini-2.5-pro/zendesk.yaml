  event_logs:
    api_call:
      reference: https://panther.com/integrations/zendesk
      value: Zendesk audit logs can be fetched by querying the Zendesk Support API,
        indicating that API interactions are logged. The Access Logs API provides
        details for each access event including the HTTP method used (e.g., GET) and
        the URL. The creation of new API tokens is also logged.
    configuration_change:
      reference: https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408828001434-Viewing-the-audit-log-for-changes-to-your-account
      value: Zendesk maintains a robust application audit log that includes security
        events such as configuration changes. The audit log tracks changes to account
        information and settings.
    data_export:
      reference: https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408828001434-Viewing-the-audit-log-for-changes-to-your-account
      value: Data export actions from Zendesk are captured in the audit log with an
        'Activity type' of 'Exported'. Data can be exported in formats like CSV, Full
        JSON, or XML. For the built-in export option, a zip file containing the data
        is sent via email.
    role_assignment:
      reference: https://panther.com/integrations/zendesk
      value: Account owner or user role changes are common security use cases for
        Zendesk logs.
    security_policy_change:
      reference: https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408828001434-Viewing-the-audit-log-for-changes-to-your-account
      value: The audit log tracks changes to account information and settings, which
        would include security policy changes. Zendesk allows defining granular access
        privileges and email notifications for admin access changes, which are related
        to security policies. The Access Log API aids in defining permissions and
        addressing security risks.
    user_account_creation:
      reference: https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408828001434-Viewing-the-audit-log-for-changes-to-your-account
      value: Activities related to creating new users are not captured in the audit
        log; it only tracks updates to existing users.
    user_login:
      reference: https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408828001434-Viewing-the-audit-log-for-changes-to-your-account
      value: Zendesk maintains a robust application audit log that includes security
        events such as user logins. However, an older review in 2016 noted that agent
        logins were noticeably missing from audited events. The main audit log entries
        capture an 'Activity type' of 'Signed in'.
  event_logs_licensing_level:
    reference: https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408828001434-Viewing-the-audit-log-for-changes-to-your-account
    value: The Zendesk audit log is available only to Enterprise and Enterprise Plus
      plan customers. The Access Logs API, which provides more detailed access event
      information, requires the Advanced Data Privacy and Protection add-on.
  ingestion_methods:

  invalidate_sessions_api:
    reference: hallucinated link doublecheck content
    value: The Zendesk Sessions API allows administrators to view and terminate one
      or more active sessions for users, which signs out the user. The API provides
      endpoints for deleting a single session, bulk deleting sessions, and deleting
      the currently authenticated session. The Bulk Delete User Sessions API specifically
      allows admins, agents, and end users to delete all sessions for a specified
      user by providing the user_id.
  known_automation_tools:
  - reference: https://n8n.io/integrations/zendesk/
    value: n8n, an open-source workflow automation tool, lists Zendesk as an integration,
      suggesting it can be used for automating tasks within Zendesk.
  revoke_api_key_api:
    reference: hallucinated link doublecheck content
    value: Zendesk's documentation from a 2016 security incident mentions that AWS
      keys used by Zendesk to access their AWS environment were compromised, and as
      a precaution, they recommended rotating credentials for Marketplace or private
      apps that saved authentication credentials like API keys or passwords. They
      also advised uploading new TLS certificates and revoking old ones if they were
      uploaded before November 1, 2016. While this indicates that API keys exist and
      rotation is a recommended security measure in case of compromise, direct API
      endpoints for programmatic revocation of specific API keys (user-generated tokens
      vs. system-generated keys) were not explicitly detailed in the provided search
      results beyond the general recommendation to rotate them. The audit logs can
      show the creation of new API tokens.
  session_timeout_configuration:
    reference: hallucinated link doublecheck content
    value: Zendesk allows administrators to customize session expiration periods for
      both team members and end-users. By default, team members are signed out after
      60 minutes of inactivity and end users after eight hours. These settings can
      be configured in Admin Center under Security > Advanced, on the Authentication
      tab. The session expiration countdown starts when a browser is closed or a tab
      is quit, or when the computer is put to sleep or turned off. The Zendesk for
      Microsoft Teams app relies on Zendesk tokens and their lifetime for sessions
      and does not automatically lock the session or log out an account after a period
      of inactivity itself.
  suspend_user_api:
    reference: https://www.n8n.io/integrations/n8n-nodes-base.zendesk
    value: Zendesk provides an API to suspend users. The Suspend User (Zendesk) activity
      is available and requires a valid Zendesk user ID. Suspending a user prevents
      them from signing in, and any new support requests from their registered identities
      are added to the suspended tickets queue. Suspended users also cannot create
      new tickets via the API or receive notifications from Guide articles. When an
      agent is suspended, their paid agent seat is still considered occupied. It is
      possible to suspend users manually through the UI as well. There is no native
      function in Zendesk that can schedule automatic suspension, suggesting automation
      would require API utilization and external scheduling.
  user_status_api:
    reference: https://developer.zendesk.com/api-reference/ticketing/users/users/
    value: The Zendesk Users API allows retrieval of user information, including a
      'status' field which can be 'active' or 'inactive', indicating if the user's
      account is active. The 'active' boolean field in the Users API indicates if
      a user has been deleted. The 'last_login_at' field is also available, showing
      the last time a user signed in or made an API request using an API token. Audit
      logs can also be used to monitor user changes, including account owner or user
      role changes, and changes to MFA settings.
  user_toggle_api:
    reference: https://developer.zendesk.com/api-reference/ticketing/users/users/
    value: The Users API has an 'active' property which is a boolean indicating if
      a user has been deleted. The 'status' field in the Users API (for Zendesk Sell,
      but mentioned in context of Zendesk users) indicates 'active' or 'inactive'.
      Suspending a user prevents them from signing in. While a direct 'toggle' API
      to switch between active/suspended status with session invalidation as a side
      effect isn't explicitly detailed as a single API call, the ability to suspend
      a user (which prevents login) and manage sessions independently through their
      respective APIs exists. Reddit discussions suggest that automatic user suspension
      would require utilizing the API and external scheduling, implying direct programmatic
      suspension is possible.
