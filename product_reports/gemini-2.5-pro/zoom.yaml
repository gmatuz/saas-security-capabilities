      about an API to programmatically revoke API keys or personal tokens.
  session_timeout_configuration:
    reference: hallucinated link doublecheck content
    value: Zoom has configurable session timeouts. Previously, an institution configured
      Zoom to log users out after 24 hours from initial login as a best practice,
      but this was later removed. Additionally, Zoom has an automatic timeout for
      idle meetings. For free accounts, meetings have a 40-minute limit, which can
      be extended by upgrading to a Pro account, allowing for a 30-hour meeting duration.
      Paid license users should ensure they are signed into the correct paid account
      to avoid the 40-minute limit.
  suspend_user_api:
