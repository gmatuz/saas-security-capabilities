  user_management_api_authentication_acquisition_steps: The primary method for programmatic user management is the Keeper Commander CLI. Authentication is typically handled by logging into Commander, which can be configured for various authentication methods, including master password and SSO. It does not use a simple, static API key in the traditional sense for user management scripts; rather, it uses the authenticated session of the administrator running the commands.
