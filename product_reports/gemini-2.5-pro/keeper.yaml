  invalidate_sessions_api:
    reference: hallucinated link doublecheck content
    value: Uncertain. The search results discuss session timeout configurations and
      device approvals, but there is no explicit mention or documentation found that
      describes an API or other programmatic method to invalidate all or specific
      active user sessions.
  known_automation_tools: []
  revoke_api_key_api:
    reference: hallucinated link doublecheck content
    value: Uncertain. The provided search results mention API provisioning with SCIM
      and API explorer, but there is no specific documentation or mention of an API
      to programmatically revoke API keys or personal tokens.
  session_timeout_configuration:
    reference: hallucinated link doublecheck content
    value: Keeper's role enforcement policies allow for configuration of login settings,
      including master password complexity and expiration. While MFA prompting frequency
      can be configured (e.g., every login, once every 30 days for mobile devices),
      the documentation does not explicitly detail minimum values or granular session
      timeout configurations.
  suspend_user_api:
    reference: https://docs.keeper.io/enterprise-guide/user-management-and-lifecycle#user-status
    value: Uncertain. While Keeper offers user management and roles, and the ability
      to enforce policies like 2FA and password complexity, direct programmatic suspension
      of a user account via API with immediate effect on sessions is not explicitly
      detailed in the provided search results. The documentation focuses more on reporting
      and logging user activity rather than direct response actions on user accounts.
  user_status_api:
    reference: https://docs.keeper.io/enterprise-guide/user-management-and-lifecycle#user-status
    value: Uncertain. The Keeper Admin Console provides a user status report and the
      Security Audit screen displays information about user security scores, password
      strength, and 2FA status. However, an explicit API for programmatically checking
      if users are active, suspended, disabled, or non-existent is not detailed in
      the provided search results.
  user_toggle_api:
    reference: https://docs.keeper.io/enterprise-guide/user-management-and-lifecycle#user-actions
    value: Uncertain. While Keeper provides user management within the Admin Console,
      and allows for setting policies related to master password expiration and 2FA,
      there is no explicit API or programmatic method detailed in the search results
      to toggle a user's active status (e.g., active to suspended/disabled) and if
      such a toggle would automatically disable active sessions.
