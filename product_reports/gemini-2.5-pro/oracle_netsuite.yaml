  rbac_api_assignment:
    reference: https://help.openconnectors.ext.hana.ondemand.com/home/67b1cb8
    value: yes - Roles can be assigned to users and permissions can be managed for
      roles, which can be done through the UI by an Administrator. Given the availability
      of Web Services API, it is implied that role and permission assignments can
      be managed programmatically. [11, 33, 41]
  rbac_support:
    reference: https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/saas/netsuite/ns-online-help/section_N321756.html
    value: yes - NetSuite uses a role-based access control (RBAC) system. Roles define
      permissions for viewing and editing data and are linked to centers (user interfaces).
      NetSuite offers standard roles and allows administrators to create custom roles
      with specific permissions. [11, 27, 38, 41, 42]

      value: uncertain - No specific information found regarding suspended/disabled
        costs for this license type. However, for full user licenses, inactive users
        do not count. [10]
  sso_license_level_requirement:
    reference: https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/saas/netsuite/ns-online-help/section_159375136122.html
    value: The SAML Single Sign-on feature needs to be enabled using the Administrator
      role under Setup > Company > Enable Features, SuiteCloud subtab. SSO is included
      with the NetSuite platform license. [2, 6, 37]
  sso_support:
    reference: https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/saas/netsuite/ns-online-help/section_159375136122.html
    value: yes - SAML 2.0, OpenID Connect, Native SSO. Supports IdP-initiated and
      SP-initiated SAML SSO. Compatible with Oracle IDCS, Oracle IAM, Okta, Azure
      AD, OneLogin, and Imprivata. [2, 4, 6, 16, 22, 30]
  user_management_api_authentication_acquisition_steps:
    reference: https://help.openconnectors.ext.hana.ondemand.com/home/67b1cb8
    value: To enable Web Services API access, an administrator needs to assign the
      'Web Services' permission with 'Full' level to a specific role. This role can
      then be designated as 'Web Services Only' to restrict UI access. [33]
  user_management_api_authentication_mechanisms:
    reference: https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/saas/netsuite/ns-online-help/chapter_4577280938.html
    value: OAuth 2.0 and Token-based Authentication (TBA) are supported for API access.
      [15]
  user_management_api_licensing_level:
    reference: https://help.openconnectors.ext.hana.ondemand.com/home/67b1cb8
    value: uncertain - While API access is available, specific licensing levels tied
      solely to the user management API (beyond general platform access) were not
      explicitly detailed in the provided search results. The Web Services feature
      needs to be enabled. [33]
  user_management_api_support:
    reference: https://help.openconnectors.ext.hana.ondemand.com/home/67b1cb8
    value: yes - NetSuite supports user management through APIs. Users can connect
      to NetSuite using Web Services, which requires the 'Web Services' permission
      with 'Full' level. This allows for programmatic access to user-related data.
      Additionally, bulk uploads of employee records using CSV files are supported.

    api_call:
      reference: https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/saas/netsuite/ns-online-help/section_156570320384.html
      value: NetSuite provides REST Web Services Execution Logs that detail API requests,
        including date/time, duration, status, user email, HTTP method and status
        code, and URL, with sensitive fields masked and logs retained for 7 days.
        Web services logs for auditing and troubleshooting API requests are also available.
        Script execution logs (for SuiteScript) can be configured to track audit messages
        and debug data, but by default track errors and are stored for up to 30 days.
        The `log.audit(options)` method in SuiteScript can log audit messages.
    configuration_change:
      reference: https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/saas/netsuite/ns-online-help/section_4577281258.html
      value: System Notes track changes to nearly all record types in NetSuite, including
        customizations and configurations, showing the date, user, changed field,
        old value, and new value. Other audit functions include Workflow History,
        Saved Search/Report Audit Trail, Preferences Audit Log, and System Notes Audit
        Log.
    data_export:
      reference: https://www.getgsi.com/blog/en-us/netsuiteblog/netsuite-auditing-and-data-management-features
      value: Audit trails for reports and saved searches can indicate if a saved search
        was exported. The 'Activity Log' feature, requiring the 'Compliance 360 SuiteApp',
        can track user activity with customer records, including whether records were
        viewed, modified, or deleted.
    role_assignment:
      reference: https://blog.netwrix.com/creating-a-netsuite-audit-log/
      value: NetSuite utilizes role-level access controls. While a complete audit
        trail tracks transactions by user login and timestamps changes, explicit log
        schemas specifically for role assignments were not found. However, System
        Notes track changes to customizations and configurations, which likely include
        role assignments. The Login Audit Trail can also be configured to review activity
        by users with specific roles.
    security_policy_change:
      reference: https://emergetech.com/netsuite-login-best-practices/
      value: NetSuite offers features like IP address restrictions and multi-factor
        authentication (MFA). Changes to these settings would likely be captured within
        'System Notes' or other audit logs that track configuration changes, as these
        notes track changes to customizations and preferences.
    user_account_creation:
      reference: https://blog.netwrix.com/six-ways-to-track-activity-in-netsuite/
      value: Uncertain. While 'System Notes' generally track changes to records and
        the 'Activity Log' monitors actions on customer data by users, explicit documentation
        on a dedicated log for 'user account creation' specifically for B2B administrative
        users was not found. It is highly probable these events would be captured
        within broader system notes.
    user_login:
      reference: https://www.starfishetl.com/connect/NetSuite/Splunk
      value: NetSuite offers a 'Login Audit Trail' to track user logins, including
        login time, source IP address, and details for failed SOAP web services authentication
        attempts. This trail captures user, role, and IP address. Saved searches can
        be created to review last login dates for employees and their assigned roles.
  event_logs_licensing_level:
    reference: https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/saas/enterprise-performance-management-common/cgsad/integration_with_custom_siem_tools.html
    value: The search results do not explicitly detail specific licensing levels required
      for accessing security audit logs. However, the 'Compliance 360 SuiteApp' is
      required to utilize the 'Activity Log' feature.
  ingestion_methods:
  - reference: https://www.reddit.com/r/Netsuite/comments/rgzq5k/netsuite_log_retrieval_api/
    value: NetSuite provides REST and SOAP Web Services APIs that can be used for
      integration and data migration, including fetching results from pre-existing
      saved searches like the Login Audit Trail.
  - reference: https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/saas/netsuite/ns-online-help/section_4430384449.html
    value: NetSuite allows for direct logging of audit messages within SuiteScript
      using the `log.audit(options)` method, which appear on the Execution Log tab.
  - reference: https://www.integrate.io/integrations/netsuite/elasticsearch/
    value: Third-party integration platforms like Tray.io, Integrate.io, Census, and
      StarfishETL offer connectors to pull data from NetSuite into other systems,
      including SIEMs.
  - reference: https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/saas/enterprise-performance-management-common/cgsad/integration_with_custom_siem_tools.html
    value: For some Oracle Cloud environments (not specifically NetSuite ERP), access
      logs can be downloaded daily and forwarded to a SIEM tool. It is uncertain if
      this exact method applies directly to NetSuite's core ERP logs.
  log_export_options:
    tools_connectors:
      reference: hallucinated link doublecheck content
      value: Log export can be achieved through NetSuite's REST and SOAP Web Services
        APIs, particularly by fetching results from saved searches. Third-party integration
        platforms and connectors (e.g., Tray.io, Integrate.io, StarfishETL, Census)
        provide mechanisms to extract and transfer data from NetSuite to external
        systems like SIEMs. There is no direct evidence of FTP or zip file exports
        as native security log export options.
  monitoring_products:
  - reference: https://tray.ai/connectors/netsuite-splunk-integrations
    value: Splunk can be integrated with NetSuite using third-party connectors from
      platforms like Tray.io and StarfishETL. Some users have implemented custom solutions
      to get NetSuite execution logs into Splunk due to limitations with native logging.
  - reference: https://www.aptible.com/docs/core-concepts/integrations/sumo-logic
    value: Sumo Logic can integrate with NetSuite, with connectors available through
      platforms like Tray.io. While a direct Sumo Logic app for NetSuite wasn't explicitly
      found, Sumo Logic offers integrations for various cloud and SaaS applications.
  - reference: https://www.getcensus.com/sync/elasticsearch-to-netsuite
    value: Elasticsearch can be integrated with NetSuite for data syncing and analysis
      using platforms like Census and Integrate.io. NetSuite also utilizes Elasticsearch
      for scaling and meeting security requirements like HIPAA and PCI/DSS.

  invalidate_sessions_api:
    reference: https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/saas/netsuite/ns-online-help/section_161192337588.html#Request-to-the-Logout-Endpoint
    value: Uncertain. While NetSuite has session management features, including configurable
      session timeouts, and the login audit trail captures IP addresses at the beginning
      of a session, there is no explicit mention of an API to programmatically invalidate
      all or specific active user sessions. The information provided focuses on authentication,
      password policies, and general session management, but not on forced session
      termination via API.
  known_automation_tools:
  - reference: https://www.etterramli.com/post/how-to-utilize-netsuite-s-login-audit-trail-for-user-activity-analysis
    value: NetSuite offers a 'Login Audit Trail' which is a specialized search to
      track user logins, including when and from where they logged in (IP address).
      It allows for simple and advanced search modes, filtering, and saving searches.
      It can also be used to find details about failed SOAP web services authentication
      requests. This is a built-in UI tool for investigation rather than an automation
      tool directly.
  - reference: https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/saas/netsuite/ns-online-help/chapter_N327688.html
    value: NetSuite provides comprehensive audit trail features to track and monitor
      user activities, data modifications, and system configuration changes [2, 3,
      12, 14, 19, 25, 26, 44]. These audit trails can be used to identify suspicious
      behavior, aid in troubleshooting, and ensure compliance. While not an automation
      tool itself, it provides the critical data for incident investigation that could
      feed into automation.
  - reference: https://www.oracle.com/corporate/security-practices/corporate/security-incident-response/
    value: NetSuite integrates with Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)
      systems for monitoring security alerts and logs. Oracle NetSuite has a dedicated
      security team that responds to security incidents 24/7 and executes response
      actions when required, indicating a potential for SOAR integration or at least
      a structured incident response process. NetSuite also uses Intrusion Detection
      Systems (IDSs).
  - reference: https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/saas/netsuite/ns-online-help/section_4254975694.html
    value: NetSuite provides an 'Issue Token and Revoke Token REST Services' which
      indicates programmatic capabilities for managing TBA tokens, which could be
      part of automation for credential compromise scenarios.
  revoke_api_key_api:
    reference: https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/saas/netsuite/ns-online-help/section_4254975694.html
    value: It is possible to programmatically revoke Token-Based Authentication (TBA)
      tokens in NetSuite using REST services. Revoking a token makes it inactive permanently,
      though it remains in the system for auditing purposes. When an application used
      for TBA is deleted, all associated tokens are revoked. If an administrator removes
      roles from an entity, the tokens remain active but cannot be used for login
      unless the roles are re-added. Deleting an entity associated with a token will
      result in the deletion of the token. TBA tokens are distinct from user credentials
      and do not expire with password rotation policies .
  session_timeout_configuration:
    reference: https://docs.oracle.com/en/cloud/saas/netsuite/ns-online-help/chapter_N327688.html
    value: NetSuite allows for configuration of password policies, including session
      timeout rules, through Setup > Company > General Preferences. Two-factor authentication
      (2FA) sessions can also be configured for a duration ranging from 'Per Session'
      to 30 days, after which a user will be prompted for 2FA again .
  suspend_user_api:
    reference: https://www.atticus.ph/blog/netsuite-user-management-best-practices-for-access-control-and-security
    value: Uncertain. While NetSuite offers user management capabilities including
      roles and permissions, and the ability to immediately offboard users, direct
      programmatic APIs specifically for suspending users were not explicitly found
      in the search results. User access is controlled through roles, and revoking
      roles from an entity does not make associated tokens inactive, but prevents
      the entity from using them to log in unless roles are added back [17, 20]. Deleting
      an entity (employee, vendor, etc.) will delete associated tokens . The closest
      related information found describes managing user access through the UI.
  user_status_api:
    reference: https://www.etterramli.com/post/how-to-utilize-netsuite-s-login-audit-trail-for-user-activity-analysis
    value: Uncertain. While NetSuite's Login Audit Trail allows tracking of user login
      attempts, including dates, times, and IP addresses, and helps monitor user activity,
      a direct API specifically for querying user login status (active vs. suspended/disabled)
      was not explicitly identified. The audit trails provide historical data on access
      and changes [3, 12, 19, 25, 26, 44], but real-time status API for user accounts
      beyond successful/failed login attempts is not directly referenced.
  user_toggle_api:
    reference: https://www.atticus.ph/blog/netsuite-user-management-best-practices-for-access-control-and-security
    value: Uncertain. While NetSuite allows administrators to manage user roles and
      permissions, and offboard users immediately, there is no explicit mention of
      a direct API to toggle a user's status between active/suspended/disabled and
      whether this action automatically invalidates active sessions. The emphasis
      in the search results is on role-based access control and manual user management
      through the UI, as well as the impact of removing roles or deleting entities
      on TBA tokens.
