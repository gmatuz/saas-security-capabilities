  invalidate_sessions_api:
    reference: https://help.tableau.com/current/api/rest_api/en-us/REST/rest_api_ref_auth.htm#sign_out
    value: The 'Sign Out' method in the REST API invalidates the authentication token
      for the current session, effectively logging the user out. There is no specific
      endpoint to invalidate a session for *another* user. The common workaround is
      to remove the user from the site or revoke their Personal Access Token (PAT).

  revoke_api_key_api:
    reference: https://help.tableau.com/current/api/rest_api/en-us/REST/rest_api_ref_auth.htm#revoke_personal_access_token
    value: 'The REST API provides a "Revoke Personal Access Token" method. A site
      administrator can revoke a user''s Personal Access Token (PAT) using its ID.
      The endpoint is `DELETE /api/api-version/sites/site-id/personal-access-tokens/pat-id`.'
  session_timeout_configuration:
    reference: https://help.tableau.com/current/online/en-us/session_lifetime.htm
    value: Site administrators can configure the session lifetime for Tableau Cloud.
      The inactive session timeout can be set from a minimum of 15 minutes to a maximum
      of 240 minutes. This is configured in the site's Settings page.
  suspend_user_management_api:
    reference: https://help.tableau.com/current/api/rest_api/en-us/REST/rest_api_ref_users_and_groups.htm#update_user
    value: 'Suspending a user is achieved by updating the user''s site role to "Unlicensed"
      using the "Update User" REST API method. The endpoint is `PUT /api/api-version/sites/site-id/users/user-id`.
      Setting the site role to "Unlicensed" effectively blocks the user from accessing
      any site content.'
  user_status_api:
    reference: https://help.tableau.com/current/api/rest_api/en-us/REST/rest_api_ref_users_and_groups.htm#query_user_on_site
    value: The "Query User On Site" REST API method can be used to retrieve details
      about a specific user, including their site role and last login time. An "Unlicensed"
      role indicates the user is suspended. The endpoint is `GET /api/api-version/sites/site-id/users/user-id`.
  user_toggle_api:
    reference: https://help.tableau.com/current/api/rest_api/en-us/REST/rest_api_ref_users_and_groups.htm#remove_user_from_site
    value: A user can be removed from a site entirely using the "Remove User from
      Site" REST API method. The endpoint is `DELETE /api/api-version/sites/site-id/users/user-id`.
      This is a more permanent action than suspending (unlicensing) them.

        and 'LoginFailed' are logged.
    configuration_change:
      reference: https://help.tableau.com/current/online/en-us/activity_log_type_ref.htm
      value: The Activity Log records various configuration changes. Events such as

      value: The Activity Log captures changes related to security settings. The 'UpdateSite'
        event logs changes to site-wide security settings, such as session timeout
        or authentication configurations. The 'activity_log_settings_change' event
        tracks changes to the log settings themselves. [31]

      value: The Activity Log records user login events, specifically 'LoginSuccess'
        and 'LoginFailed' event types, which include details like the user ID and
        the time of the event. [1, 27]
  event_logs_licensing_level:
    reference: https://help.tableau.com/current/online/en-us/activity_log.htm
    value: Access to the detailed Activity Log for export to an external SIEM requires
      the 'Advanced Management' add-on for Tableau Cloud. [1, 8] Standard plans include
      access to 'Admin Insights', which provides a 90-day retention of aggregated
