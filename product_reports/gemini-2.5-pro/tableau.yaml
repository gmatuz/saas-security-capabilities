  event_logs:
    api_call:
      reference: https://help.tableau.com/current/api/rest_api/en-us/REST/rest_api_concepts_auth.htm
      value: The Tableau Server REST API requires credentials tokens for requests,
        which can be Personal Access Tokens (PAT) or username/password. An issue was
        identified where Tableau Server inadvertently logged PATs in plain text into
        internal log repositories for a subset of customers using the REST API for
        authentication; this was resolved with critical updates. Activity Log records
        changes made through the Permissions Dialog UI and REST API.
    configuration_change:
      reference: https://help.tableau.com/current/server/en-us/logs_loc.htm
      value: Tableau Server generates log files including information about what is
        happening on the server, what the service or process is doing, and errors
        or warnings. TSM logging levels can be adjusted to trace configuration changes.
        Tableau Cloud's Activity Log captures events related to changes within Tableau
        Cloud Manager tenants, such as changing site role capacity limits. Logs related
        to configuring Tableau Server can be found in `tabadmin.log`.
    data_export:
      reference: https://help.tableau.com/current/online/en-us/activity_log_monitor_data_exports.htm
      value: Tableau Cloud's Activity Log allows for monitoring of data export actions
        to maintain data security and compliance. This includes downloading published
        content (workbooks, data sources, flows) and accessing or exporting data from
        published views or dashboards (e.g., as PNG or CSV). To monitor data exports,
        Activity Log data needs to be in a structured and queryable format, which
        can be achieved by setting up Activity Log to write log files to an AWS S3
        bucket and then importing them into a monitoring tool like Splunk or a cloud
        data warehouse.
    role_assignment:
      reference: https://help.tableau.com/current/online/en-us/activity_log_overview.htm
      value: Tenant events in Tableau Cloud Manager record changes like assigning
        users access and roles on a site. Site events for Tableau Cloud and Activity
        Log events for Tableau Server track permissions changes, including adding
        or removing users from a group.
    security_policy_change:
      reference: https://help.tableau.com/current/online/en-us/activity_log_audit_permissions.htm
      value: Tableau Cloud's Activity Log allows auditing of permission changes, such
        as adding or removing users from a group, moving content, and explicitly changing
        content permissions. These changes are recorded in JSON format with specific
        keys like `eventType`, `permissionType`, and `capabilityValue`. Tableau Server
        also includes security features like access control and can be configured
        for encryption standards.
    user_account_creation:
      reference: https://help.tableau.com/current/online/en-us/activity_log_overview.htm
      value: Tenant events in Tableau Cloud Manager include assigning users access.
        Tableau Server Repository stores information about Tableau Server users, groups,
        and group assignments. Tableau's general security documentation mentions adding
        users to a server.
    user_login:
      reference: https://help.tableau.com/current/online/en-us/activity_log_overview.htm
      value: Tableau Cloud's Activity Log captures login successes and failures as
        site events. Tableau Server also has pre-built audit logs that include user
        activity and log-on history, and more detailed reports can be built by enabling
        access to Server's internal data tables.
  event_logs_licensing_level:
    reference: https://help.tableau.com/current/online/en-us/license_product_keys.htm
    value: For Tableau Cloud, the Activity Log feature, which provides detailed event
      data for analysis and auditing, requires 'Advanced Management'. Tableau Server
      with 'Advanced Management' also includes the Activity Log. Tableau Enterprise
      license edition is designed for advanced administration, security, and data
      management on Tableau Server. Tableau Plus is a license level for Tableau Cloud
      that includes enhanced security and customer-managed encryption keys.

      value: Tableau Cloud's Activity Log can be configured to send log data to Amazon
        S3. For Tableau Server, log files are stored locally and can be collected
        into a zipped archive using `tsm maintenance ziplogs`. The Tableau REST API
        can be used to manage server resources programmatically, and Personal Access
        Tokens (PATs) are a more secure authentication method for API calls.
  monitoring_products:
  - reference: https://help.tableau.com/current/online/en-us/activity_log_overview.htm
    value: Tableau Cloud's Activity Log data can be integrated with monitoring tools
      such as Splunk or Amazon EventBridge for querying log fields. Activity Log data

  invalidate_sessions_api:
    reference: https://help.tableau.com/current/api/rest_api/en-us/REST/rest_api_ref.htm
    value: The Tableau Server REST API includes a 'Sign Out' method that invalidates
      the authentication token for the current session. This ensures that the token
      cannot be used for further API calls. While a direct API to invalidate all sessions
      for a specific user was not explicitly found, signing out of a session programmatically
      is a documented capability. Session timeouts also automatically sign users out
      after a predefined duration.

  revoke_api_key_api:
    reference: https://docs.gitguardian.com/secrets-detection/secrets-detection-engine/detectors/specifics/tableau_pat
    value: Tableau's REST API provides methods to revoke Personal Access Tokens (PATs).
      A server administrator can revoke all personal access tokens created by server
      administrators using the 'Revoke Administrator Personal Access Tokens' method.
      Individual users can also revoke their own PATs from their account settings.
      Site administrators can list and revoke users' PATs on Tableau Cloud. PATs are
      long-lived and can be revoked without disabling the associated Tableau user,
      offering granular control over access rights. This is particularly useful for
      managing access for consultants or automating security purges of tokens.
  session_timeout_configuration:
    reference: https://community.tableau.com/s/question/0D54T000017wBFzSAM/how-to-set-up-session-time-out-at-user-or-site-level-on-tableau-server
    value: Tableau Server's session timeout can be configured at the server level
      using TSM commands. The 'wgserver.session.idle_limit' setting controls the number
      of minutes after which a user session will time out due to inactivity, with
      a default of 240 minutes. Another setting, 'vizqlserver.session.expiry.minimum',
      defaults to 5 minutes and dictates when a VizQL session is eligible for discard
      if the VizQL process is low on memory. There is no explicit configuration to
      set different session timeout values for individual sites or users; the timeout
      is generally set at the server level and applies commonly.
  suspend_user_api:
    reference: https://help.tableau.com/current/server/en-us/users_site_roles.htm
    value: Tableau's REST API allows for managing users, including adding and removing
      them from a site. While there isn't a direct 'suspend user' API call, removing
      a user from a site or setting their site role to 'Unlicensed' can effectively
      suspend their access. The 'Remove User from Site' method is available and returns
      a 204 response code upon success, indicating the user has been removed. Server
      administrators can manage users across multiple sites, and site administrators
      can manage users within their specific site. The API can also be used to update
      a user's site role, which determines their maximum level of access.
  user_status_api:
    reference: hallucinated link doublecheck content
    value: The Tableau REST API provides a 'Get a filtered, sorted list of users of
      a site' method, which can be used to retrieve information about users on a site.
      This can include their status, such as whether they are active or unlicensed.
      Site roles, which determine a user's maximum access level, include 'Unlicensed'
      for users who cannot edit or view any content. The 'View, Manage, or Remove
      Users' UI option allows administrators to see details about users, including
      content they own and their account settings.
  user_toggle_api:
    reference: https://www.it.northwestern.edu/docs/Tableau-Admin-Ref.pdf
    value: Tableau's REST API allows for updating user details, including their site
      role. While there isn't a direct 'toggle user' API, changing a user's site role
      to 'Unlicensed' effectively disables their ability to log in and access content.
      The API also supports updating a user's full name, email address, and password.
      Server administrators can manage user roles across sites, and site administrators
      can manage roles within their site. If a user is removed from an Active Directory
      group, their site role is not automatically changed and would need manual adjustment.
