      value: Canva's audit logs include events such as installing a Canva App. The
        Canva API allows automated interaction with the Canva platform for creating,
        editing, and managing designs programmatically. Security recommendations for
        the Connect APIs suggest adding security-specific logging for authentication
        and authorization events, object reads and writes, and permission changes.
        An OpenAPI description for the Connect API is publicly available.
    configuration_change:
      reference: https://www.canva.dev/docs/audit-logs/actions/audit-logs/

        settings based on team member roles, which helps in managing information leakage
        risks. While direct log schemas for role assignments weren't explicitly found,
        the existence of such granular controls implies logging capabilities for compliance.

        brand controls to manage access to elements and templates and control external
        sharing. Canva Shield is a collection of trust and safety tools. While these

      reference: hallucinated link doublecheck content
      value: Canva provides audit logs that record user activities, including logins.
        For individual users, Bitdefender mentions regularly monitoring account activity,
        such as logins from unrecognized devices, and suggests enabling two-factor
        authentication (2FA) and passkeys for enhanced security. For Enterprise users,
        dashboards can show user logins by user, login_type, and OAuth platform.
  event_logs_licensing_level:

      tools, with features like audit logs, analytics, and real-time alerts. While
      not specific to Canva SIEM integration, it offers a general automation platform

      provides API access for logs.
  - reference: https://help.drata.com/en/articles/9300560-canva-connection

  invalidate_sessions_api:
    reference: https://www.canva.dev/docs/connect/api-reference/authentication/revoke-token/
    value: The Canva Connect APIs allow revoking an access token or a refresh token
      using the /v1/oauth/revoke endpoint. If a refresh token is revoked, its lineage
      (access tokens created from it) is also revoked, and the user's consent for
      the integration is revoked, requiring the user to re-authorize. [17]
  known_automation_tools:
  - reference: https://www.tines.com/case-studies/canva/
    value: Tines is used by Canva's incident response team to scale up and improve
      their security detections and response work, providing a flexible and programmable

    value: Make (formerly Integromat) is an automation platform that can connect Canva
      with over 2,500 pre-built apps, allowing for automation of IT processes, including
      incident management and AI integration. [28]
  - reference: https://www.canva.dev/blog/engineering/summarise-post-incident-reviews-with-gpt4/
    value: Canva uses GPT-4-chat to auto-generate Post Incident Report (PIR) summaries,
      improving data quality and reducing the workload of reliability engineers. [22]
  - reference: https://www.helpnetsecurity.com/2025/07/09/kanvas-open-source-incident-response-case-management-tool/
    value: Kanvas is an open-source incident response case management tool built in
      Python that leverages Excel as a backend for investigators to manage tasks,
      take notes, and visualize data, with future plans for integration with threat
      intelligence platforms like MISP and OpenCTI. [35]
  revoke_api_key_api:
    reference: https://www.canva.dev/docs/connect/api-reference/authentication/revoke-token/
    value: Canva has partnered with GitHub secret scanning to automatically detect
      and revoke Canva secrets (including access tokens and client secrets) that have
      been published to public GitHub repositories. [11] The /v1/oauth/revoke endpoint
      can be used to revoke access and refresh tokens. [17]
  session_timeout_configuration:
    reference: https://www.canva.dev/docs/connect/api-reference/authentication/generate-access-token/
    value: Canva Connect API access tokens are valid for a specified period, currently
      4 hours, and can be refreshed using a refresh token. [6] While this indicates
      a technical session timeout for API integrations, no general session timeout
      configuration options for end-user web sessions were found in the provided search
      results. Users can manually sign out from all devices. [31]
  suspend_user_api:
    reference: https://www.canva.dev/docs/scim/delete-user/
    value: Canva's SCIM API allows deprovisioning a SCIM user by setting the user's
      'active' attribute to 'false' via a PATCH operation. This is effectively a soft
      delete or suspension. [7]
  user_status_api:
    reference: https://www.canva.dev/docs/connect/error-responses/
    value: Uncertain. While the SCIM API allows setting a user's 'active' status [7],
      there is no explicit API documentation found that allows querying the active
      status of users in general for investigative purposes. The 'user_not_found'
      error code exists [36], which implies some form of user lookup, but not a general
      status check.
  user_toggle_api:
    reference: https://www.canva.dev/docs/scim/delete-user/
    value: While there isn't explicit documentation for a 'toggle' API, the Canva
      SCIM API's PATCH operation can set a user's 'active' attribute to 'false' to
      deprovision them [7]. This suggests a programmatic way to change a user's status.
      User suspension is typically a method to disable active sessions implicitly.
