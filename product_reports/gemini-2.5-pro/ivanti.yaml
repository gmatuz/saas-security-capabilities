    api_call:
      reference: hallucinated link doublecheck content
      value: The Ivanti Traffic Manager audit log records changes made using the Control
        API and REST API. Ivanti Service Manager Add-On for Splunk can import incidents,
        service requests, and problems from Ivanti Service Manager via Service Manager
        REST APIs. Ivanti Policy Secure acts as a REST API server for IBM QRadar,
        and REST API access for the admin user needs to be enabled.
    configuration_change:
      reference: https://docs.datadoghq.com/integrations/ivanti-connect-secure/
      value: Ivanti Endpoint Manager stores auditing events in the core database and
        can optionally send them to the Windows Event Viewer, including configuration
        changes. The Transaction Audit log in Ivanti Service Manager lists create,
        update, and delete events, and can be configured for auditing. Ivanti Traffic
        Manager's audit log monitors configuration changes by user and source IP address.
        Ivanti Connect Secure provides logs on Administrator Activities, including
        configuration changes.
    data_export:
      reference: hallucinated link doublecheck content
      value: Ivanti Endpoint Manager allows exporting or printing the audit log. The
        audit log in Ivanti can also be exported to a CSV file. For Ivanti Device
        and Application Control, JSON files can be output, which can be consumed by
        tools like Filebeat for Elasticsearch. There is no cleaning done by the DLL
        for these JSON files, so the consumer needs to take care of deleting them
        when processed.
    role_assignment:
      reference: https://help.ivanti.com/ld/help/en_US/LDMS/10.0/Windows/audit-c-event-log.htm

        role (administrator only)'. In Ivanti Endpoint Manager, if the auditing configuration
        role is assigned and the console restarted, the 'Auditing configuration' tab
        appears, allowing auditing events to be written to the event log.
    security_policy_change:
      reference: hallucinated link doublecheck content
      value: Ivanti Device Control events, including audit events like 'ADMINAUDIT',
        can be forwarded to SIEM solutions. Ivanti Endpoint Security (Device Control)
        SIEM integration allows forwarding of events like DEVICE-ATTACHED and READ-DENIED,
        which can be related to security policy enforcement.
    user_account_creation:
      reference: https://help.ivanti.com/ht/help/en_US/ISM/2020/admin/Content/Configure/Logging/Transaction%20Audit%20Log.htm
      value: Ivanti Neurons for Service Management can be configured to create new
        user accounts via workflows, and this action would likely be logged within
        the system's audit trails. While direct schema for user creation audit logs
        isn't explicitly detailed, Ivanti Service Manager's Transaction Audit log
        tracks 'create' events enabled per business object class.
    user_login:
      reference: hallucinated link doublecheck content
      value: Ivanti products log successful and failed login attempts, as well as
        logouts. For Ivanti Service Manager, the Transaction Audit log includes 'User
        login ID' for events. Ivanti Traffic Manager's audit log monitors recent login
        attempts. Ivanti Connect Secure also provides authentication logs with information
        about login-related events, SSL negotiation failures, and remote address changes.
  event_logs_licensing_level:
    reference: https://www.ivanti.com/
    value: Uncertain. While Ivanti documentation outlines various logging capabilities
      and SIEM integrations, specific licensing requirements for accessing security
      audit logs are not explicitly mentioned in the provided search results. Some
      integrations, like Ivanti Service Manager Add-On for Splunk, are built by Ivanti
      Development, suggesting they are part of the core product or an add-on.

      to automatically create security incidents. It supports out-of-the-box integrations
      for gathering information to manage assets and create security incidents when
      needed. Ivanti Neurons for ITSM can be extended to support security operations
      and incident management. Automation processes in Ivanti Service Manager can
      be configured to automate behaviors, such as notifying incident owners, labeling
      incidents as breached, or closing incidents based on SLA deadlines. Ivanti Neurons
      for ITSM also uses AI to streamline incident processes, classify incidents,

  revoke_api_key_api:
    reference: https://docs.spectrocloud.com/user-management/authentication/api-key/revoke-api-key/
    value: Yes, Ivanti allows administrators to delete or disable existing CAM REST
      API keys through the CAM Administrator UI. This process involves selecting 'Tools
      > User Policies and Authentication > REST API Keys' and then choosing to delete
      or change (disable) the key. API keys can also be activated or deactivated during
      creation. For Ivanti Service Manager, API keys can be deleted from the Configuration
      console by navigating to 'Configure > Security Controls > API Keys', selecting
      the relevant key group, and clicking delete. Tenant administrators can revoke
      an API key they created or one created by another user within the tenant, making
      it inactive until re-activated.
  session_timeout_configuration:

    value: Uncertain. While Ivanti's User API allows getting information about user
      accounts, including whether an account is enabled or locked, there is no explicit
      mention of an API endpoint or method to programmatically suspend or disable
      a user account. The 'Is the account enabled?' field in the response implies
      a status that could be toggled, but no direct API for modification was found
      in the search results.
  user_status_api:
    reference: https://docs.imprivata.com/mam/content/topics/mdm/702.html
    value: Yes, the Ivanti Neurons for MDM User API allows retrieving information
      about all accounts, which includes fields such as 'Is the account enabled?'
      and 'Is the account locked?'. This enables checking if users are active (can
      log in) or if their accounts are suspended/disabled/locked. The API call is
      a GET request to '/api/v1/ldap/import/user/status' and requires Tenant Admin
      credentials.

    reference: https://help.ivanti.com/mi/help/en_us/cld/admin/ivanti/97/all/en-us/Enabling_and_Disabling_Users.htm
    value: Uncertain. The Ivanti Neurons for MDM User API includes a field 'Is the
      account enabled?' when retrieving user information. While this indicates a user's
      enabled/disabled status, the provided search results do not explicitly detail
      an API endpoint or method to directly toggle this status for a user, or if toggling
      this status would invalidate active sessions.
