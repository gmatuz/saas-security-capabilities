  user_management_api_authentication_acquisition_steps:
    reference: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Mc4W0-UWgM
    value: To acquire API credentials for user management, you typically need to create
      an integration key (client ID) and client secret for OAuth 2.0. For JWT grant,
      an application needs to impersonate a DocuSign user. The process often involves
      setting up an app in the DocuSign developer console and obtaining an OAuth token
      with relevant scopes (e.g., signature scope, admin scope). [17, 18, 30]
  user_management_api_authentication_mechanisms:
    reference: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Mc4W0-UWgM
    value: DocuSign APIs, including the Admin API and eSignature REST API, support
      OAuth 2.0 authentication. Recommended grant flows are confidential authorization
      code grant and JSON Web Token (JWT) grant. API keys are also used. [7, 17, 18,
      30]
  user_management_api_licensing_level:

  user_management_api_support:
    reference: https://www.postman.com/docusign/docusign-s-public-workspace/documentation/gpq5550/docusign-admin-api
    value: yes - DocuSign provides a User Management API, which is part of the DocuSign
      Admin API, to automate user management. The DocuSign eSignature REST API also
      includes a Users resource for managing account users. These APIs enable creation,
      deletion, retrieval, and updating of user information. [7, 9, 12, 21]

  - https://www.technology.pitt.edu/security
  invalidate_sessions_api:
    reference: https://developers.docusign.com/platform/auth/consent/
    value: The DocuSign system does not automatically invalidate existing access tokens
      when a new access token is requested. While individual users can revoke their
      consent for an application, which invalidates refresh tokens, live access tokens
      and JWT tokens remain active until they naturally expire. There is no explicit
      API found to programmatically invalidate all active sessions for a specific
      user.
  known_automation_tools:
  - reference: https://www.docusign.com/blog/developers/integrate-the-docusign-monitor-api-your-siem
    value: DocuSign Monitor API provides near real-time visibility into account activity
      (login attempts, password changes, envelope deletions) to help security teams

    value: Abnormal Security offers a solution for DocuSign account takeover protection,
      integrating via API to ingest and normalize access data for continuous monitoring
      of human behavior and detection of deviations.
  revoke_api_key_api:
    reference: https://docs.gitguardian.com/secrets-detection/secrets-detection-engine/detectors/specifics/docusign_api_key
    value: API keys (secrets) can be manually revoked through the DocuSign web console
      on the 'Apps and Keys' page. For applications with organizational administrative
      consent (e.g., JWT Grant), this consent can be revoked using the DocuSign Admin
      tool, which will revoke access for the entire organization. If a single user
      provided consent, it can only be revoked manually by that user. [8, 19, 29,
      30]
  session_timeout_configuration:
    reference: hallucinated link doublecheck content
    value: DocuSign administrators can configure session timeout durations for web
      applications, mobile applications, and recipient sessions. The minimum allowed
      value is 1 minute, and the maximum is 120 minutes. The default is 20 minutes
      for all. For embedded signing, the session URL defaults to a 300-second (5-minute)
      timeout, which can be increased to a maximum of 900 seconds (15 minutes) by
      contacting DocuSign support.
  suspend_user_api:
    reference: hallucinated link doublecheck content
    value: DocuSign does not offer a direct API to 'suspend' a user with that specific
      status. Instead, a user's membership can be 'closed' (deactivated) using the
      DELETE method in the eSignature REST API. This action is reversible, but the
      user will need to click a link in an email to reactivate. This operation requires
      administrator privileges.
  user_status_api:
    reference: https://developers.docusign.com/docs/esign-rest-api/reference/users/users/list/
    value: The DocuSign REST API provides a `Users::list` method that can filter results
      by user account status, including 'ActivationRequired', 'ActivationSent', 'Active',
      'Closed', and 'Disabled'. It can also include the login status of each user.
  user_toggle_api:
    reference: hallucinated link doublecheck content
    value: Programmatic toggling of user status between active/suspended/disabled
      is not directly supported by the DocuSign API in the sense of a simple switch.
      The API allows for 'closing' (deactivating) a user's membership, which is reversible
      upon user re-activation via an email link. Silent activation via API is deprecated.
      User activation without email requires a claimed email domain, SSO configuration,
      and specific domain settings.
