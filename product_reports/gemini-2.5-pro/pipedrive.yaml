  rbac_api_assignment:
    reference: https://pipedrive.readme.io/docs/marketplace-scopes-and-permissions-explanations
    value: yes - The Pipedrive API has scopes that allow apps to do many things an
      administrator can do, including managing users and permissions. The 'admin'
      scope specifically allows for creating, reading, updating, and deleting users
      and permissions.
  rbac_support:
    reference: https://support.pipedrive.com/en/article/permission-sets

      sets determine what users can do, while visibility groups control what users
      can see. Users and teams can have specific PermissionSets and Roles, which are
      part of the visibility groups feature. Admin users have global permissions and
      can manage user access rights.

        only authorized applications can access the CRM. While API security protocols
        like OAuth 2.0 authentication and HTTPS encryption are in place, specific
        details about audit logging of every API call to the business and administrative
        APIs with a detailed schema were not found. The API changelog tracks key changes
        to the API itself.
    configuration_change:
      reference: hallucinated link doublecheck content
      value: The Security Dashboard includes an "Audit log" section that provides
        a log of all security-related changes made in the company account by any user
        in the past two months. This would likely include configuration changes related
        to security settings.
    data_export:
      reference: https://support.pipedrive.com/en/article/security-features-in-pipedrive
      value: Pipedrive provides security alerts for data leakage and loss, specifically

      value: Pipedrive's Security Center provides user access and device logs, showing
        which users are accessing the account, along with device, location, and login
        time. This information is available for the past two months. Account access
        alerts can be configured to notify admins via email when a user logs in from
        a new device or location, a new user is invited, a user has more than 3 failed
        login attempts, or a user requests a password reset.

  invalidate_sessions_api:
    reference: https://pipedrive.readme.io/docs/app-uninstallation
    value: Uncertain. There is no explicit mention of an API to programmatically invalidate
      all or specific active user sessions. However, the OAuth 2.0 token revocation
      endpoint can be used to revoke access that a Pipedrive user has granted to an
      app, which would invalidate the refresh token for that app's session.

    value: Admins can revoke access to a user's API token by de-selecting the 'Access
      their own API token' option within the permission sets settings in the Pipedrive
      web app. There is no explicit API endpoint found to programmatically revoke
      a personal API key, however, for OAuth 2.0, there is a token revocation endpoint
      to revoke access granted by a Pipedrive user to an app.
  session_timeout_configuration:
    reference: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-platform/admin/user-session-management
    value: Uncertain. While Pipedrive offers security features like Two-Factor Authentication
      (2FA), Single Sign-On (SSO), and the ability to enforce password rules and IP
      address/time-based access restrictions,,, no specific documentation detailing
      configurable session timeout values or an API for managing them was found in
      the search results.
  suspend_user_api:
    reference: https://pipedream.com/apps/pipedrive/integrations/dock-certs/revoke-credential-with-dock-certs-api-on-new-person-update-instant-from-pipedrive-api-int_R7s8E66E
    value: Uncertain. While Pipedrive offers APIs for user management and permission
      sets, and the ability to disable API access for users, there is no explicit
      mention or evidence of a direct API endpoint to programmatically "suspend" or
      "disable" a user's login access to the Pipedrive UI.
  user_status_api:
    reference: https://developers.pipedrive.com/docs/api/v1/Users
    value: Pipedrive offers a 'Users' API endpoint which allows for retrieving data
      about users within the company, including current user data., The API also provides
      endpoints to list user permissions, which define what actions users are allowed
      to perform and which features they can access.
  user_toggle_api:
    reference: hallucinated link doublecheck content
    value: Uncertain. While administrators can enable or disable API access for users
      through permission sets in the UI,, and there are user management capabilities
      through the API to list users and their permissions,, there is no clear API
      endpoint identified that allows for programmatically toggling a user's active/suspended
      status to directly disable their login sessions for the UI.
