      reference: hallucinated link doublecheck content
      value: Calendly allows users to export data manually as CSV files from various
        pages. Owners and admins can export the activity log as a CSV file. Outgoing

        (specific to domain control)." Calendly for Enterprise integrates with identity
        providers like Okta, OneLogin, and Microsoft Azure for user provisioning via
        SCIM.
    user_login:
      reference: https://calendly.com/blog/enterprise-security-compliance
      value: Calendly for Enterprise provides an activity log where IT and security
        teams can monitor key account actions, including logins (both successful and
        failed). This log helps in quickly reacting to security incidents, reviewing
        events, understanding changes, and identifying potentially suspicious activity.
  event_logs_licensing_level:
    reference: https://calendly.com/blog/enterprise-security-compliance
    value: Access to the activity log and its export capabilities (including SIEM
      integration via API) is available to Calendly owners and admins. These features
      are part of the Calendly Enterprise plan.

  invalidate_sessions_api:
    reference: https://github.com/calcom/cal.com
    value: Uncertain. While Calendly allows for revoking access/refresh tokens via
      their OAuth 2.0 API, which can disconnect applications [5], there is no explicit
      mention of an API to invalidate all active user sessions within the Calendly
      application itself, such as forcing a user logout from all devices. However,
      user provisioning through SCIM with identity providers like Okta or Azure AD
      can automate user lifecycle management, including automatically removing employees
      from Calendly when they leave the company, which would presumably revoke their
      access. [1]
  known_automation_tools:
  - reference: https://calendly.com/blog/enterprise-security-compliance
    value: Calendly integrates with SIEM providers via REST API for activity log integration,
      allowing for filtering and analysis of key account actions such as logins, user
      invites, and changes to organizational settings. [1]
  - reference: https://calendly.com/integration
    value: Calendly integrates with Zapier, a no-code automation platform, to connect
      with other tools and automate workflows. Examples include adding new Calendly
      events to Google Sheets or sending Telegram messages for new invitees. [16,
      10]
  - reference: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=3TgWyOG5lTk
    value: Calendly can be automated using Pabbly Connect for workflows like sending
      reminders, updating databases, or notifying teams when a new appointment is
      scheduled. It also supports automating meeting cancellations for invalid invitees
      and sending Slack notifications. [26, 27]
  - reference: https://rollout.com/integration-guides/calendly/api-essentials
    value: Calendly provides a REST-based API (API v2) that utilizes JSON and adheres
      to standard HTTP methods, authentication, and response codes, enabling various
      functionalities such as retrieving Calendly links, syncing scheduled meetings,
      and managing users. [25]
  - reference: https://calendly.com/blog/enterprise-security-compliance
    value: Calendly offers integrations with identity providers like Okta, OneLogin,
      and Microsoft Azure for advanced user provisioning, including SCIM enablement
      to automatically remove employees. [1]
  revoke_api_key_api:
    reference: hallucinated link doublecheck content
    value: Calendly provides an API endpoint to revoke an access/refresh token. This
      endpoint requires the client ID, client secret, and the token to be revoked.
      [5] Personal Access Tokens (PATs) can be generated, and once generated, they
      are unretrievable. If a PAT needs to be revoked, it's not explicitly stated
      if there's an API for it, but the documentation mentions that conditions can
      result in an access token being revoked. [24]
  session_timeout_configuration:
    reference: hallucinated link doublecheck content
    value: Uncertain. The provided documentation mentions Calendly's general security
      posture, including ISO 27001 and SOC 2 Type 2 certifications, and internal security
      protocols [1, 3, 4, 7]. It also highlights features like SSO and user lifecycle
      management (SCIM) for account protection. [4] However, specific details or configuration
      options for session timeout values are not explicitly mentioned in the search
      results.
  suspend_user_api:
    reference: hallucinated link doublecheck content
    value: Calendly offers API capabilities for managing organization users, including
      inviting users, revoking invitations, and removing users from the organization.
      These administrative actions are available through the API, with broader access
      provided by tokens generated by an admin or owner. [14]
  user_status_api:
    reference: https://github.com/calcom/cal.com
    value: Uncertain. The Calendly API allows for managing organization users, including
      inviting, revoking invitations, and removing users [14]. However, specific API
      endpoints to check if a user is active (can log in) versus suspended/disabled
      or non-existent are not explicitly detailed in the provided search results.
      Admin/Owner roles can access data across the entire organization, which might
      include user status, but direct API access for this specific check is not confirmed.
      [14]
  user_toggle_api:
    reference: https://github.com/calcom/cal.com
    value: Uncertain. While Calendly's API allows for removing users from an organization
      [14] and SCIM provisioning can automate user removal upon leaving a company
      [1], there is no explicit documentation found regarding an API to simply 'toggle'
      a user's status between active/suspended/disabled and whether such a toggle
      would automatically invalidate active sessions.
