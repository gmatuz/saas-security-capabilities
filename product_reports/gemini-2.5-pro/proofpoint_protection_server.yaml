  event_logs:
    api_call:
      reference: https://developer.tessian.com/documentation/api/index.html
      value: Proofpoint offers a SIEM API that provides access to security event data,
        including blocked or permitted clicks to threats (URL Defense) and blocked
        or delivered messages containing threats (URL Defense or Attachment Defense).
        This API returns data in SIEM-compatible formats like Syslog and JSON. The
        PoD (Proofpoint on Demand) Log API also provides a real-time email processing
        log feed via secure WebSocket (WSS) in JSON format. This API allows identification
        of mail and message filtering events, and includes fields describing connection,
        envelope, message, and filter details. The SIEM API and PoD Log API require
        authentication using API keys or JWT tokens.
    configuration_change:
      reference: https://prod.docs.oit.proofpoint.com/configuration_guide/auditing_configuration_changes.htm
      value: Proofpoint provides an audit trail that shows changes made to policies
        and settings. This information is available to Super Administrators. Audit
        entries are created for configuration changes in areas like Alerts (status
        changes), Alert & Prevent Rules (activation/inactivation), and Alert & Prevent
        Settings (e.g., disabling notifications). The audit log displays the time
        of change, the console user who made the change, their client IP, the area
        changed, and the specific item.
    data_export:
      reference: hallucinated link doublecheck content
      value: Proofpoint Protection Server (PPS) can export audit logs to an Excel
        spreadsheet (XLS) file. This can be done from the 'Status > Audit Log' page,
        and exporting does not remove records from the audit log. Audit records are
        saved for 60 days on the system, and exporting allows for longer preservation.
    role_assignment:
      reference: https://help.proofpoint.com/Proofpoint_Essentials/Email_Security/Administrator_Topics/Other_Features/How_to_customize_access_control
      value: Uncertain. There is no direct evidence in the search results describing
        the logging of role assignments for Proofpoint Protection Server administrative
        users. It is plausible that such actions would be logged internally for auditing
        purposes, but specific schema or availability information is not documented
        in the provided sources.
    security_policy_change:
      reference: https://help.forcepoint.com/websec/en-us/on-prem/85/web_admin_guide/guid-9bac8092-5dcf-49ae-bb18-20b624f70d0e.html
      value: Proofpoint Protection Server provides an audit trail for changes made
        to policies and settings. This includes modifications to Alert & Prevent Rules
        and other security-related configurations.
    user_account_creation:
      reference: hallucinated link doublecheck content
      value: Uncertain. While configuration changes are audited, there is no explicit
        mention of audit logs for the creation of administrative user accounts within
        the provided search results for Proofpoint Protection Server. It is a common
        security practice for such events to be logged, but specific documentation
        was not found.
    user_login:
      reference: hallucinated link doublecheck content
      value: Uncertain. While Proofpoint Protection Server logs various system events
        and email-related activities, explicit documentation detailing audit logs
        for administrative user logins was not found during this research. However,
        many B2B applications inherently log such events for security and compliance.
