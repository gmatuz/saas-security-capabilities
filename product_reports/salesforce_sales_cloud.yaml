The JWT bearer flow does not use it directly.\n5.  **Select OAuth Scopes:** Add the following scopes required for SCIM: 'Manage user data via APIs (api)' and 'Manage user data via SCIM (scim)'.\n6.  **Save the App:** Save the Connected App. It may take up to 10 minutes to become active. \n7.  **Retrieve Consumer Details:** Once saved, click 'Manage Consumer Details' to get the 'Consumer Key' (Client ID) and 'Consumer Secret'.\n8.  **Generate Access Token:** Use the obtained Consumer Key and an appropriate OAuth 2.0 flow (e.g., JWT Bearer Token Flow for server-to-server integration) to programmatically request an access token from the Salesforce token endpoint (e.g., https://MyDomainName.my.salesforce.com/services/oauth2/token)."

For server-to-server integrations using the JWT flow, this can be a placeholder.\n5.  **Select OAuth Scopes:** Choose the necessary permissions. For full user management, select 'Full access (full)' or 'Manage user data via APIs (api)'.\n6.  **Save and Get Credentials:** Save the app. After a few minutes, go to 'Manage Consumer Details' to find your 'Consumer Key' (Client ID) and 'Consumer Secret'.\n7.  **Initiate OAuth Flow:** Use the Consumer Key and Secret to initiate an OAuth 2.0 flow (e.g., Authorization Code Flow for web apps, or JWT Bearer Token Flow for backend services) to obtain an access token."
