    your IdP. 2. In Zoho, navigating to the Zoho Directory or Admin Panel to enable
    provisioning. 3. The IdP will provide an Authorization URL and Token Endpoint
    URL. 4. You will authorize the connection, which generates the necessary OAuth
    tokens for the IdP to manage users in Zoho.'

      reference: https://www.zoho.com/crm/security.html

incident_response:
  suspend_user_management_api:

    reference: https://www.zoho.com/crm/developer/docs/api/v8/update-user.html
  invalidate_sessions_api:
    value: There is no direct API endpoint to invalidate a specific user's session.
      However, deactivating a user via the API will terminate their active sessions.

      and mobile application sessions" option checked will invalidate their refresh
      token and log them out.
    reference: https://help.zoho.com/portal/en/community/topic/oauth-refresh-token-invalidated-on-password-change
  revoke_api_key_api:
    value: OAuth 2.0 refresh tokens can be revoked by making a POST request to the
      /oauth/v2/token/revoke endpoint with the token as a parameter. For serverless
      functions, a static API key can be regenerated, which invalidates the old one.
    reference: https://www.zoho.com/crm/developer/docs/api/v8/revoke-token.html
  user_toggle_api:
    value: The Users API allows for toggling a user's status between 'active' and
      'inactive'. This is done by sending a PUT request to the user's resource URI.
      This effectively activates or deactivates the user.
    reference: https://www.zoho.com/crm/developer/docs/api/v8/update-user.html
  user_status_api:
