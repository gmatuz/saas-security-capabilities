    1. On-premise: edit `filter.cfg` and set `com.proofpoint.admin.apigui.enable=t`.
    2. In the PPS UI, create a role of type *API* and enable the `pss` and `Quarantine` modules.
    3. Assign a user to that role; this username/password pair is used for HTTP Basic Auth to the REST API
       (default port 10000). For PoD instances, open a support ticket to have an API role assigned.
