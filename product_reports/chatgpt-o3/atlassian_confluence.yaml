    An organization admin generates a SCIM API key and base URL in Atlassian Administration
    (under **Security → Identity providers**) when setting up user provisioning.
    During setup, Atlassian shows a unique SCIM Base URL and API key once; copy and store them
    securely.  The API key is then used by the identity-provider SCIM client (e.g. Okta or Azure AD)
    as a bearer token to authenticate SCIM requests to Atlassian.

    An organization administrator can create an **Organization API key** via **admin.atlassian.com**
    by selecting the organization and navigating to *Settings → API keys*. From there, create a new
    API key (optionally with scopes) and copy the generated value (shown only once).  Use this key
    as a bearer token when calling Atlassian admin REST APIs for user management.
