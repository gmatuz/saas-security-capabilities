  scim_authentication_acquisition_steps: |
    1. Sign in to the Adobe Admin Console as an admin and navigate to **Settings > Identity > Directories**, then select your federated directory.
    2. Open the **Sync** tab and choose “Add Azure Sync” or “Add Google Sync.”
    3. During sync configuration, the Admin Console generates a **SCIM endpoint URL** and **Secret Token**.
    4. Copy the Secret Token and Endpoint URL. In your identity-provider’s provisioning settings, paste the token (as the API Bearer token) and the endpoint URL.
    5. Finish the IdP-side mapping and group selection. The IdP will then use SCIM to create, update, or deactivate users automatically in Adobe.

  user_management_api_authentication_acquisition_steps: |
    1. A System Admin creates a **Service Account integration** for the User Management API in the Adobe Developer Console.
    2. Use the Client ID and Client Secret to request an access token from Adobe IMS (`client_credentials` grant).
    3. Call User Management endpoints with `Authorization: Bearer <token>` and `x-api-key: <Client ID>`.
    4. Use the API to create, update, license, group, or remove users as needed.

      value: "No dedicated user login audit logs are available in Adobe Acrobat’s SaaS platform. The Adobe Admin Console’s audit logs do **not** capture end-user sign-in events or usage; they only record administrative changes at the organizational level. In other words, there is currently no feature to track or export individual user login history via Adobe’s native tools."

    role_assignment:
      value: "Adobe’s audit logs **do** record changes in user roles and entitlements. For example, when a user is added to or removed from a product (license assignment) or granted an admin role, these events appear in the Admin Console audit log. The audit log answers questions like *“When was a new user added, and by whom?”* or *“Why did a user lose access to a product?”* (Note: Changes to shared-asset collaborator roles are tracked separately in Content Logs.)"

      value: "There is no indication that Adobe Acrobat’s SaaS platform provides audit events for API calls made against its services. The Admin Console audit log explicitly does **not** include product-level events, which would encompass API operations within Acrobat or Document Cloud.

They also log file creations, edits, moves, deletions, and sharing events (invitations, collaborator-role changes).

    security_policy_change:
      value: "Yes – changes to security-relevant policies in the Admin Console are audited.
