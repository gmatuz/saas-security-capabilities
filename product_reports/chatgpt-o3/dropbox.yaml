    Dropbox does not provide a public SCIM API. Instead, use an identity provider
    integration (e.g. Azure AD or Okta) which will prompt a Dropbox team admin to authorize access.
    This generates an OAuth 2.0 access token that the IdP uses to create, update, or deactivate
    users in Dropbox (see: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/saas-apps/dropboxforbusiness-provisioning-tutorial).
    Developers building a custom solution can create a Dropbox Business API app with
    “Team member management” access and perform an OAuth 2 flow or use the App Console to
    generate an access token for provisioning.

  user_management_api_authentication_acquisition_steps: >-
    To use the Dropbox Business API for user management, an admin must obtain an OAuth
    access token with the proper scope. The easiest way is to create a Dropbox Business API
    app via the Dropbox App Console with “Team member management” permissions, then click
    “Generate access token” to get a token (see:
    https://dropbox.tech/developers/generate-an-access-token-for-your-own-account).
    In production, implement the OAuth 2.0 authorization flow: direct an admin to Dropbox’s
    consent page and request the `team_member_management` scope, then store the returned
    access token for API calls.
