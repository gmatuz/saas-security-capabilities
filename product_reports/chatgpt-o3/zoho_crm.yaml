  scim_authentication_acquisition_steps: "Zoho CRM itself doesn’t expose a SCIM API. Instead, if using Zoho Directory for SCIM provisioning, you must obtain a SCIM endpoint URL and token from the Zoho Directory Admin Panel. For example, when integrating Okta or Azure AD, Zoho Directory generates a SCIM 2.0 base URL and an OAuth bearer token (\"SCIM token\"). Admins can copy this token from Zoho Directory and supply it as the authentication header in the IdP’s SCIM configuration."

  user_management_api_authentication_acquisition_steps: "To call Zoho CRM’s user management APIs, you must obtain an OAuth 2.0 access token. In Zoho’s API Console, register a client (or use the Self-Client option) and request the `ZohoCRM.users.ALL` scope (or specific scopes like `ZohoCRM.users.CREATE`, etc.). Generate an authorization code and exchange it for an access token (and refresh token). Use the access token in the HTTP Authorization header as `Zoho-oauthtoken <token>` for API requests. The refresh token can be used to renew the access when it expires. This process ensures you have a valid OAuth token to authenticate API calls."
