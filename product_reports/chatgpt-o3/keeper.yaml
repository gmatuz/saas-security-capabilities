  scim_authentication_acquisition_steps: |
    1. In the **Keeper Admin Console** open **Provisioning > Add Method > SCIM**.  
    2. Keeper displays a **SCIM Base URL** and a **Provisioning Token** – click **Generate** if none exists.  
    3. **Copy the token**, then click **Save**.  
    4. Use the token as a **Bearer** value in the `Authorization` HTTP header when calling any `https://keepersecurity.com/api/rest/scim/v2/<node_id>/...` endpoint.

  user_management_api_authentication_acquisition_steps: |
    1. Install **Keeper Commander** (`pip install keepercommander`) or download the binary.  
    2. Run `keeper shell` and execute `login <admin_email>` – approve the new device (email or push) and enter your **Master Password**.  
    3. Commander stores a long-lived **device / session token** in `~/.keeper/config.json`; subsequent scripted calls reuse this token with no further MFA.  
    4. Use enterprise commands such as `enterprise-user --add`, `enterprise-user --lock`, `team --add-user`, etc.
