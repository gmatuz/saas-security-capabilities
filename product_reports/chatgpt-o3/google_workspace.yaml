    reference: "https://developers.google.com/workspace/admin/directory/v1/guides/manage-users"
  user_management_api_authentication_acquisition_steps: |
    1. **Enable API & Service Account:** Create a Google Cloud project and enable the Admin SDK Directory API. Create a service account and download its JSON key.
    2. **Grant Domain-Wide Delegation:** In the Google Admin console (Security > API controls > Domain-wide Delegation), authorize the service account’s Client ID for the OAuth scope `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/admin.directory.user`.
    3. **Obtain OAuth Token:** Use the service-account credentials to impersonate an admin user and obtain an OAuth 2.0 access token (JWT flow). This access token is then used to call the Directory API endpoints to manage users.
