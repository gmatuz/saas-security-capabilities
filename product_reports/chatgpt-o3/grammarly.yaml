      An admin generates a SCIM API token from Grammarly's admin panel under **Provisioning**. For example, clicking **Activate SCIM** and **Create token** will produce a token that serves as a bearer token for SCIM requests. In some cases (such as certain integrations), you may need to request this token from Grammarly support. Provide the resulting SCIM token to your identity provider (e.g. paste it into the **Bearer Token** field in the IdP's SCIM configuration) to authenticate SCIM calls.

      Administrators must create OAuth 2.0 credentials in the Grammarly admin panel (under **Organization** → **OAuth 2.0 credentials**). After obtaining a Client ID and Secret, they can request an OAuth access token using the client-credentials grant via Grammarly’s OAuth token endpoint. The returned access token is then used as a Bearer token in authorized API requests.
