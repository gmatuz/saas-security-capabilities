    Enable SAML SSO for the ClickUp Workspace (Enterprise plan). Once SSO is set up, navigate to the Workspace **Security & Permissions** settings. ClickUp will display a **SCIM Base URL** and a **SCIM API Token** (bearer token) for provisioning. Copy the SCIM API Token and provide it (as a Bearer token in the Authorization header) along with the Base URL in your identity provider's SCIM configuration.

    For a personal API key: In ClickUp, click your profile avatar → **Settings** → **Apps**. Click **Generate** to create a new API token, then click **Copy** to obtain it. Use this token in the `Authorization` header (as `Bearer <token>`) for API calls.  
    For multi-user integrations, create an OAuth2 app in **Apps** to get a client ID and secret, perform an OAuth flow, and use the returned access token as the bearer token for API requests.
