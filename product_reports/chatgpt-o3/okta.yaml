  scim_authentication_acquisition_steps: |
    1. An **Enterprise workspace owner** must open **Settings & Members → Identity & provisioning → SCIM provisioning**.
    2. Click **Add token** (or copy an existing token) to generate a new SCIM API token:contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}.
    3. Save this token – it will serve as the **SCIM secret** (bearer token) for authentication. For example, in Azure AD or Okta, enter the Notion SCIM **Tenant URL** (`https://www.notion.so/scim/v2`) and this **Secret Token** to connect:contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}.
    4. Use the token in an HTTP Authorization header (e.g. `Authorization: Bearer <token>`) when making SCIM API calls.

  user_management_api_authentication_acquisition_steps: |
    1. Go to the **Notion Integrations** page (developers.notion.com) and create a new internal integration for your workspace.
    2. Once created, copy the **Integration token** from the integration’s settings page:contentReference[oaicite:14]{index=14}.
    3. Use this token as a Bearer token in API requests (set `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header). Note: This integration token allows access to Notion’s public API (for reading data like users), but cannot create or remove members – those actions require SCIM (Enterprise).

    value: "Notion allows administrators on Enterprise to suspend user accounts. Through the Managed Users dashboard, a workspace owner can “Suspend the user,” which deactivates the user’s access (their content remains but they can no longer log in). This action is also available programmatically via SCIM by setting the user’s `active` attribute to false."

From the Managed Users dashboard an admin can force a logout for a specific user (“Log the user out”), immediately ending all that user’s active sessions.

    reference: "https://www.notion.com/help/managed-users-dashboard"
  revoke_api_key_api:
    value: "Yes – Integration API tokens can be revoked. Admins or integration owners can revoke an internal integration’s access token by resetting or deleting the integration. Notion logs an ‘integration.secret_reset’ event when an integration’s API secret is reset (invalidating the old token). Additionally, removing an integration entirely will revoke its credentials."

  user_toggle_api:
    value: "Yes – User accounts can be toggled active/inactive via API. Notion’s SCIM API allows updating a user’s status: setting `active=false` via a SCIM PATCH or PUT de-provisions (suspends) the user, and conversely they can be reactivated by setting `active=true`. Corresponding audit log events ‘User suspended’ or ‘User unsuspended’ are generated when an admin performs these actions."
    reference: "https://www.notion.com/help/provision-users-and-groups-with-scim"
  user_status_api:
    value: "Yes – Admins can programmatically check a user’s status. Using the SCIM API, an admin can retrieve the list of users (GET /Users) which includes each user’s `active` status field to see if they are active or suspended. In the Notion Enterprise UI, the Managed Users dashboard also clearly indicates suspended users (they appear with a crossed-out profile icon and remain listed as managed users)."
    reference: "https://www.notion.com/help/provision-users-and-groups-with-scim"
  session_timeout_configuration:
    value: "Yes – Session timeout is configurable in Notion Enterprise. By default, managed user sessions last 180 days, but workspace owners can set a custom session duration from as short as 1 hour up to 180 days before re-authentication is required. This allows enforcing shorter session lifetimes for security."
