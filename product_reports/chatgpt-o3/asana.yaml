  scim_authentication_acquisition_steps: |
    1. **Create a Service Account (Enterprise only).**  
       In the Admin Console, super-admins create a new service account under **Security → Service accounts**.  
    2. **Generate the SCIM token.**  
       When the service account is created, Asana issues a long-lived SCIM access token that appears once in the UI.  
    3. **Copy and store the token securely.**  
       The token is the credential for SCIM and is treated like a password.  
    4. **Use the token.**  
       Add `Authorization: Bearer <SCIM_TOKEN>` to calls against `https://app.asana.com/api/1.0/scim`.
