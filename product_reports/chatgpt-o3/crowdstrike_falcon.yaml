    1. **Log in** to the Falcon console as an administrator and navigate to **Support & Resources > API Clients and Keys**.  
    2. **Create a new API client** (under OAuth2 API clients) with an appropriate name and select the required scopes (e.g., user management permissions).  
    3. **Save** to generate the **Client ID** and **Client Secret** for the new API client (record the secret, as it is shown only once):contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}.  
    4. Use the Client ID and Secret to obtain an OAuth2 **access token** (for example, by making a POST request to the CrowdStrike OAuth2 token endpoint). Use this access token as a Bearer token to authenticate subsequent user management API calls.
