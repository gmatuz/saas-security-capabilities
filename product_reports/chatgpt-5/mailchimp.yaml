identity_and_access:
  sso_support:
    value: no — no native enterprise SSO (SAML/OIDC/Kerberos) for logging in to Mailchimp;
      Okta lists the Mailchimp app as SWA (password vaulting) rather than federated
      SSO
    reference: https://www.okta.com/integrations/mailchimp/
  sso_license_level_requirement:
    value: not applicable — no native SSO feature tier called out by vendor
    reference: https://www.okta.com/integrations/mailchimp/

    reference: https://www.okta.com/integrations/mailchimp-provisioning-connector-by-aquera/

      connector (e.g., Aquera) rather than credentials from Mailchimp
    reference: https://www.okta.com/integrations/mailchimp-provisioning-connector-by-aquera/
  user_management_api_support:
    value: no — account user lifecycle (invite/change role/remove) is administered
      in the UI; vendor docs describe only UI steps and do not expose user endpoints

security_monitoring:
  event_logs:
    user_login:
      value: Mailchimp provides account-level security notifications that can be enabled
        to alert when a login occurs with your username and when a login occurs from
        a new location. These are delivered via email/SMS; no separate audit-event
        schema is documented in vendor docs.
      reference: https://mailchimp.com/help/activate-account-notifications/
    role_assignment:
      value: uncertain — roles (Owner, Admin, Manager, Author, Viewer) and access
        changes are supported, but vendor docs do not document an audit log or event
        stream for role assignments.
      reference: https://mailchimp.com/help/manage-user-levels-in-your-account/
    api_call:
      value: uncertain — Mailchimp exposes Marketing and Transactional APIs and API
        keys grant full account access, but vendor docs do not describe any audit
        log of API calls or an API to retrieve API access logs.
      reference: https://mailchimp.com/help/about-api-keys/
    data_export:
      value: Notifications can be enabled to alert when someone attempts to download
        your audience (export). Separately, account data can be exported via the Marketing
        API /account-exports endpoint as a ZIP file, but a security audit trail for
        export actions is not documented.
      reference: https://mailchimp.com/help/activate-account-notifications/
    configuration_change:
      value: Mailchimp can send notifications for certain configuration/security changes,
        including 'API key generated' and 'account contact information changed'. No
        broader configuration-change audit log schema is published.
      reference: https://mailchimp.com/help/activate-account-notifications/
    user_account_creation:
      value: uncertain — user invitations and access management are documented, but
        no audit log endpoint or export of user add/remove events is described.
      reference: https://mailchimp.com/help/manage-user-levels-in-your-account/
    security_policy_change:
      value: uncertain — security features (2FA, account verification checks) are
        documented, but there is no vendor documentation of an auditable event stream
        when security policy settings are changed.
      reference: https://mailchimp.com/help/set-account-security-options/
  event_logs_licensing_level:
    value: Webhooks for audience/campaign events require Standard or Premium plans

incident_response:
  suspend_user_api:
    value: No public API to suspend users. Account Owners/Admins can revoke a user’s
      access in the Users page; when access is revoked, any API keys that user created
      are removed and the user is logged out of the Mailchimp mobile apps.
    reference: https://mailchimp.com/help/manage-user-levels-in-your-account/
  invalidate_sessions_api:
    value: Uncertain—no documented API to invalidate web sessions. Documented behavior
      is that revoking a user’s access logs them out of the Mailchimp iOS/Android
      apps; web-session invalidation is not specified.
    reference: https://mailchimp.com/help/manage-user-levels-in-your-account/
  revoke_api_key_api:
    value: 'Revocation supported via UI: Owners/Admins can revoke API keys from Profile
      > Extras > API keys. Documentation does not expose an endpoint to programmatically
      create/revoke API keys; revoking a user removes keys they generated.'
    reference: https://mailchimp.com/help/about-api-keys/
  user_toggle_api:
    value: No public API documented to toggle user state (active/suspended). Access
      changes (invite, change role, revoke) are performed via the Users page by Owner/Admin.
    reference: https://mailchimp.com/help/manage-user-levels-in-your-account/
  user_status_api:
    value: Uncertain—there is no documented Marketing API endpoint to list account
      users or their active/disabled status. The errors doc notes the API key’s role
      is returned from the Root endpoint, but no user-management/status API is documented.
    reference: https://mailchimp.com/developer/marketing/docs/errors/
  session_timeout_configuration:
    value: No admin-configurable session timeout documented. Mailchimp relies on cookie-based
      options to reduce reauthentication (Keep me logged in and Skip this for two
      weeks) after enabling Performance & Functionality cookies.
