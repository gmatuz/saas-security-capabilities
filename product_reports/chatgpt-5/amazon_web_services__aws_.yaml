incident_response:
  suspend_user_api:
    value: No single 'suspend' API for IAM users; deactivation is performed by attaching
      an explicit Deny policy to the IAM user or removing credentials (console password,
      access keys) as documented under 'Deactivating an IAM user'.

  revoke_api_key_api:
    value: Yes. Use IAM APIs to deactivate or delete access keys. UpdateAccessKey
      changes an access key status to Inactive (programmatically revoking use), and
      you can follow with DeleteAccessKey to fully remove it.

  user_toggle_api:
    value: For IAM Identity Center (SSO) users, you can toggle user access (Disable/Enable)

      sessions. Existing application sessions end within ~30 minutes; existing IAM
      role sessions continue until the permission set session duration expires (max
      12 hours).
    reference: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/singlesignon/latest/userguide/authconcept.html
  user_status_api:
    value: Yes. Use IAM credential reports (GenerateCredentialReport/GetCredentialReport)
      to programmatically see per-user credential state (e.g., password_enabled, access_key_1_active/2_active,
      last used).
    reference: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_getting-report.html
  session_timeout_configuration:
    value: IAM Identity Center access-portal and integrated app session duration is
