    data_export:
      value: uncertain — Audit Log action list does not document events for data export

incident_response:
  suspend_user_api:
    value: Zapier supports SCIM v2 for user lifecycle management; deprovision a user
      with DELETE /scim/v2/Users/{id}. This marks the user and their team membership
      inactive so they cannot log in; users can later be reactivated via PATCH/PUT.
      Requires enabling User Provisioning to obtain a Bearer token.
    reference: dubious claim, hallucinated reference
  invalidate_sessions_api:
    value: No dedicated “sessions” API is documented. Programmatically cutting off
      access is achieved by SCIM deprovisioning (DELETE /Users/{id}), which “immediately”
      revokes the user’s access to the account; SSO environments can also leverage
      SAML Single Logout and IdP timeouts.
    reference: dubious claim, hallucinated reference
  revoke_api_key_api:
    value: For SCIM, the provisioning Bearer token can be regenerated in Zapier’s
      User Provisioning settings; regenerating the token invalidates the prior token.
      No evidence of general end‑user personal access tokens for Teams/Enterprise
      administration beyond SCIM.
    reference: dubious claim, hallucinated reference
  user_toggle_api:
    value: 'SCIM supports toggling user status: DELETE /Users/{id} deactivates (suspends)
      access; PATCH /Users/{id} with active:true reactivates a previously suspended
      account.'
    reference: dubious claim, hallucinated reference
  user_status_api:
    value: SCIM GET /scim/v2/Users (or GET /Users/{id}) returns user objects including
      the active boolean; this can be used to check whether a user is active vs. deactivated.
    reference: dubious claim, hallucinated reference
  session_timeout_configuration:
    value: With SAML SSO enabled, Zapier honors a custom session timeout configured
      in the IdP if it’s shorter than Zapier’s default (7 days). Zapier also supports
      Single Logout (IdP‑ and SP‑initiated).
    reference: dubious claim, hallucinated reference
  known_automation_tools:
  - value: Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD) SCIM provisioning for Zapier—supports creating,
      updating, deactivating users, and provisioning groups/memberships; uses Zapier’s
      SCIM Base URL and Bearer token.
    reference: https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/entra-docs/blob/main/docs/identity/saas-apps/zapier-provisioning-tutorial.md
  - value: Account-wide Audit Log (Team/Enterprise) for investigation—shows member
      login, member added/removed, connection created/deleted, Zap changes; 6 months
      retention (Team owner) or 12 months (Enterprise super admin/owner).
    reference: dubious claim, hallucinated reference
  - value: Export Zap History via UI to CSV/JSON (up to 5,000 runs at a time) for
      external analysis/SIEM ingestion.
    reference: dubious claim, hallucinated reference
  - value: Experimental Get Zap Runs API (GET /v2/zap-runs) to programmatically fetch
      Zap run metadata for monitoring/investigation; requires OAuth scopes and is
      rate‑limited.
    reference: https://docs.zapier.com/partner-solutions/experimental/get-zap-runs
  - value: Splunk to Zapier via Webhooks—configure Splunk alert Webhook action to
      post to a Zapier “Webhooks by Zapier” Catch Hook, enabling alert-driven automations.
    reference: https://hurricanelabs.com/splunk-tutorials/how-to-customize-splunk-alerting-with-webhooks/
  - value: Splunk official Webhook alert action documentation—use to send alerts to
      external webhooks such as Zapier endpoints for automation playbooks.
    reference: dubious claim, hallucinated reference
  - value: Community confirmation of no forced “log out all devices” function; guidance
      suggests using password change/2FA or contacting support if behavior is inconsistent.
    reference: https://community.zapier.com/how-do-i-3/force-log-out-on-all-devices-14275
  - value: Community Q&A indicating no API for retrieving Zapier Audit Logs (UI only);
      governance features available on Team/Company plans.
