security_monitoring:
  event_logs:
    user_login:
      value: 'Xero exposes basic login visibility inside the product UI: individual
        users can view their own last 10 logins (with IP/location), and org admins
        can view a Login History tab under Settings > Users that shows names and times
        for recent logins but is limited to a short retention window (about two weeks).
        No export/API for login history is documented on this page.'
      reference: https://cynch.com.au/resources/review-the-security-of-your-xero-logins
    role_assignment:
      value: Xero’s Assurance Dashboard (accessible to Adviser users) surfaces user
        activity and displays users’ roles and last login dates. However, there’s
        no explicit documentation confirming an audit log of role changes over time;
        thus, existence of granular role-assignment change logs is uncertain.
      reference: https://www.aafl.nz/xero-tip-of-the-month-using-the-assurance-dashboard
    api_call:
      value: There is no documented security/audit log stream of API calls. Xero provides
        webhooks for accounting-object changes (for example invoices/contacts) and
        per-object “History & Notes” endpoints via the Accounting API, but not security
        events like logins. Therefore, availability of API-call audit logs is uncertain.
      reference: https://coefficient.io/xero-api/xero-webhooks
    data_export:
      value: Community feedback indicates Xero does not provide visibility into who
        pulled which reports; users requested such assurance/reporting and noted its
        absence. Therefore, logging of report export actions is uncertain.
      reference: https://productideas.xero.com/forums/939198-for-small-businesses/suggestions/44960347-history-notes-audit-trail-for-all-transactions
    configuration_change:
      value: Xero records transaction-level change history via “History & Notes” (who,
        what, when across items like invoices, bank transactions, contacts, etc.).
        Third-party tooling can extract this History & Notes data. There is no clear
        documentation on audit logs for global/organisation configuration changes;
        that aspect remains uncertain.
      reference: https://g-accon.com/audit-trail-in-g-accon-for-xero/
    user_account_creation:
      value: The Assurance Dashboard provides visibility of users and last login dates
        for monitoring, but there is no clear documentation confirming an audit trail
        specifically for user invite/creation events; uncertain.
      reference: https://www.aafl.nz/xero-tip-of-the-month-using-the-assurance-dashboard
    security_policy_change:
      value: Uncertain. Customer requests reference missing SSO and lack of logging
        details for MFA attempts, but there is no official documentation showing an
        audit log for security policy changes (e.g., MFA enforcement) within Xero.

  event_logs_licensing_level:
    value: Access to the Assurance Dashboard requires the Adviser user role in Xero;
      no separate paid licensing tier for security/audit logs is documented in public
      sources. Beyond role-based access, licensing requirements remain uncertain.
    reference: https://www.aafl.nz/xero-tip-of-the-month-using-the-assurance-dashboard
  monitoring_products:
  - value: Xero’s built-in Assurance Dashboard highlights user activity (including
      roles and last login), manual bank statement line edits/deletions, edited/duplicate
      supplier bank accounts, and backdated invoices/bills for anomaly checking.
    reference: https://www.aafl.nz/xero-tip-of-the-month-using-the-assurance-dashboard
  - value: Flatly provides scheduled exports of Xero data, including multiple “History+Notes”
      audit datasets (e.g., by Contact, Bank Transactions, Invoices) to destinations
      like Excel/Sheets for monitoring and review.
    reference: https://flatly.io/integrations/xero-accounting-to-excel
  - value: G‑Accon for Xero extracts “History & Notes” (audit trails) across entities
      (invoices, payments, bank transactions, contacts, etc.) into Google Sheets,
      enabling centralized review and automation.
    reference: https://g-accon.com/audit-trail-in-g-accon-for-xero/
  ingestion_methods:
  - value: Manual export of the in-product “History & Notes” report (now supports
      PDF/Excel export), allowing periodic retrieval of change/audit records for monitoring
      or external ingestion.
    reference: https://productideas.xero.com/forums/939198/suggestions/45164593
  - value: API access to per-object history via the Accounting API (e.g., GET /Invoices/{InvoiceID}/History,
      GET /Items/{ItemID}/History) through official SDKs; suitable for scripted ingestion
      of change logs tied to specific records.
    reference: https://xeroapi.github.io/xero-python/v1/accounting/index.html
  - value: Webhooks for accounting object events (e.g., invoices, contacts) to trigger
      near-real-time processing; note these are not security login events and do not
      provide security audit logs.
    reference: https://coefficient.io/xero-api/xero-webhooks
  - value: Login history visibility is limited to UI (per-user last 10 logins and
      a short-retention org login list) with no documented export/API, implying monitoring
      requires manual review or screenshots.
    reference: https://cynch.com.au/resources/review-the-security-of-your-xero-logins
  log_export_options:
    tools_connectors:
      value: 'Native: export History & Notes to PDF/Excel from the report UI. No evidence
        of built-in SIEM/syslog, FTP, or streaming export for security logs. For automated

        & Notes via API.'

incident_response:
  suspend_user_api:
    value: No public Xero API to suspend or remove users was found; the Accounting
      API exposes read-only user retrieval (GET /Users), and UI-based removal is referenced
      elsewhere. This indicates suspension/removal is done via the UI, not via API.
    reference: https://xeroapi.github.io/xero-php-oauth2/docs/v2/accounting/index.html
  invalidate_sessions_api:
    value: No documented API to invalidate or force-logout user sessions. Xero enforces
      an inactivity prompt at ~10 minutes and automatic logout at 60 minutes, with
      no admin-configurable extension.

    reference: https://devblog.xero.com/release-round-up-august-2020-4d0f077f0b9
  user_toggle_api:
    value: No evidence of an API to activate/deactivate (toggle) Xero users; community
      requests exist for broader user management endpoints (e.g., add user), implying
      such capabilities are not exposed via API at this time.
    reference: https://xero.uservoice.com/forums/5528-accounting-api?category_id=137688
  user_status_api:
    value: Read-only user listing is available via the Accounting API (GET /Users,
      with filters like IsSubscriber). There is no documented API surface showing
      a “suspended/disabled” state or allowing status changes.
    reference: https://xeroapi.github.io/xero-php-oauth2/docs/v2/accounting/index.html
  session_timeout_configuration:
    value: Xero sessions prompt for inactivity at ~10 minutes and auto-log out after
      60 minutes of inactivity; this timeout cannot be extended/configured by customers.

  known_automation_tools:
  - value: xero-python SDK Identity API supports disconnecting an org (DELETE /Connections/{id});
      usable in automation to programmatically revoke an organisation connection during
      incident response.
    reference: https://github.com/XeroAPI/xero-python/blob/master/xero_python/identity/docs/IdentityApi.md
  - value: xero-node SDK exposes helper methods disconnect(connectionId) and revokeToken()
      to remove a single org connection or revoke the refresh token (all connections)
      for automated containment.
    reference: https://github.com/XeroAPI/xero-node/blob/master/README.md

      for querying organisation users in investigations (read-only; no write/toggle).
    reference: https://xeroapi.github.io/xero-php-oauth2/docs/v2/accounting/index.html
  - value: Programmatic disconnect of a specific connection via DELETE https://api.xero.com/connections/{connectionId}
      (requires valid access token); useful to revoke a single tenant’s access for
      a compromised integration.
    reference: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65090426/xero-delete-connection-with-connection-id
  - value: .NET SDK support for DeleteConnectionAsync (Identity APIs) to automate
      disconnect actions from Xero during incident response workflows.
    reference: https://github.com/XeroAPI/Xero-NetStandard/issues/181
