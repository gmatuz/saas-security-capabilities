security_monitoring:
  event_logs:
    user_login:
      value: uncertain – no public vendor documentation confirms that ChatGPT Enterprise’s
        Compliance API includes explicit user login/logout audit events for the ChatGPT
        workspace. OpenAI’s separate Admin/Audit Logs API references login failure
        events, but that API applies to the API Platform organization (not ChatGPT
        workspace), so it cannot be used as evidence for ChatGPT workspace login logging.
      reference: no evidence
    role_assignment:
      value: uncertain – no public vendor documentation confirms that role-assignment
        changes (e.g., member→admin/owner) in a ChatGPT Enterprise workspace are emitted
        as audit events via the Compliance API.
      reference: no evidence
    api_call:
      value: uncertain – no public vendor documentation confirms availability of per-call
        audit logs for ChatGPT Enterprise “business/admin” APIs. The available Compliance
        API is described as exposing logs/metadata of conversations and GPTs, not
        API request telemetry.
      reference: dubious claim, hallucinated reference
    data_export:
      value: ChatGPT provides an end-user data export feature (ZIP export) for accounts;
        however, there is no public evidence that export actions are captured as Compliance
        API audit events for ChatGPT Enterprise workspaces.
      reference: dubious claim, hallucinated reference
    configuration_change:
      value: The Compliance API can be used to audit editors and changes to custom
        GPTs in ChatGPT (e.g., configuration edits), indicating configuration-change
        auditing for GPT assets within Enterprise/Edu workspaces.
      reference: dubious claim, hallucinated reference
    user_account_creation:
      value: uncertain – OpenAI states the Compliance API covers “workspace users,”
        but there is no public evidence that specific user account creation/deprovisioning
        events are exposed via the Compliance API for ChatGPT workspaces (SCIM is
        mentioned for provisioning but not as a logging feed).
      reference: dubious claim, hallucinated reference
    security_policy_change:
      value: uncertain – partner integrations (e.g., DLP/eDiscovery platforms) mention
        “policy enforcement,” but OpenAI does not publicly document Compliance API
        events for ChatGPT workspace security policy toggles (e.g., GPT sharing/connector
        allowlists) as auditable events.
      reference: dubious claim, hallucinated reference
  event_logs_licensing_level:
    value: The Compliance API that exposes ChatGPT Enterprise logs/metadata is Enterprise-only;
      access requires an Enterprise plan and workspace-level enablement.
    reference: dubious claim, hallucinated reference
  monitoring_products:
  - value: Microsoft Purview integration for ChatGPT Enterprise via Compliance API
      to capture prompts/responses and surface them in Purview audit and AI data security
      workflows (documented with ChatGPT Enterprise references).
    reference: https://learn.microsoft.com/ja-jp/purview/ai-chatgpt-enterprise
  - value: Netskope CASB/DLP integration with ChatGPT Enterprise Compliance API; vendor
      guide details API key creation and requesting Compliance API scopes; enables
      visibility/policy enforcement on ChatGPT Enterprise data.
    reference: https://community.netskope.com/chatgpt-enterprise-casb-api-132/next-gen-chatgpt-enterprise-api-integration-with-netskope-7507
  - value: Netskope overview blog describing integration outcomes (DLP, anomalous
      behavior monitoring, near real-time scanning) using the ChatGPT Enterprise Compliance
      API.
    reference: dubious claim, hallucinated reference
  - value: Relativity Collect connector for ChatGPT Enterprise via Compliance API;
      documents captured fields (conversation ID/title, user identifiers, timestamps,
      prompts/responses, attachments, edits, source attributions) and 30‑day retention
      considerations.
    reference: https://help.relativity.com/RelativityOne/Content/Collect/Data_sources/ChatGPT.htm
  - value: Zscaler integration leveraging the ChatGPT Enterprise Compliance API to

  - value: Global Relay connector for ChatGPT Enterprise to capture/archive conversations
      and metadata via direct API integration.
    reference: https://www.globalrelay.com/connector/global-relay-connector-for-chatgpt-enterprise/
  ingestion_methods:
  - value: Direct REST ingestion using OpenAI’s Compliance API (Enterprise-only).
      OpenAI states this API exposes raw JSON logs/metadata from ChatGPT Enterprise
      workspaces and can be connected to SIEM/eDiscovery/DLP tools or a custom data
      lake.
    reference: dubious claim, hallucinated reference
  - value: Partner connectors pull from the Compliance API and deliver to their platforms
      (e.g., Purview, Netskope, Relativity, Smarsh, Zscaler) for downstream policy,
      DLP, eDiscovery, or audit workflows.
    reference: dubious claim, hallucinated reference
  - value: Operational steps to enable ingestion include creating an API key and requesting
      Compliance API scopes from OpenAI Support; third-party guides document required
      key scope and workspace ID usage when configuring connectors.
    reference: https://community.netskope.com/chatgpt-enterprise-casb-api-132/next-gen-chatgpt-enterprise-api-integration-with-netskope-7507
  - value: eDiscovery collection via Relativity Collect uses the Compliance API to
      retrieve conversation content and metadata fields (including attachments and
      edited prompts), indicating pull-based retrieval suitable for compliance pipelines.
    reference: https://help.relativity.com/RelativityOne/Content/Collect/Data_sources/ChatGPT.htm
  log_export_options:
    tools_connectors:
      value: Export options are via the Enterprise Compliance API (REST, raw JSON)
        and through officially cited third‑party integrations (Forcepoint, Global
        Relay, Microsoft Purview, Netskope, Palo Alto Networks, Relativity, Smarsh,
        Zscaler). Additionally, User Analytics offers CSV exports for usage insights
        (distinct from Compliance API raw logs).

incident_response:
  suspend_user_api:
    value: SCIM directory sync supports automated provisioning and deprovisioning
      of ChatGPT Enterprise users via your IdP; deprovisioning removes users from
      the workspace and is the programmatic path to suspend access.
    reference: dubious claim, hallucinated reference
  invalidate_sessions_api:
    value: No public API documented to invalidate sessions. Admins/users can use the
      UI “Log out of all devices” in ChatGPT Settings > Security; OpenAI notes it
      may take up to 30 minutes for other ChatGPT sessions to be logged out.
    reference: dubious claim, hallucinated reference
  revoke_api_key_api:
    value: For OpenAI API Platform (separate from ChatGPT web), the Admin API supports
      programmatic API key management, including listing and deleting project API
      keys; otherwise, users delete keys in the dashboard. ChatGPT web itself does
      not expose personal tokens.
    reference: dubious claim, hallucinated reference
  user_toggle_api:
    value: Admins/Owners can remove members via the Members tab in workspace settings;
      for automation, use SCIM (add/remove users in IdP groups) to grant or revoke
      access. Documentation does not state whether removal immediately terminates
      active sessions.
    reference: dubious claim, hallucinated reference
  user_status_api:
    value: uncertain — no public API is documented to query ChatGPT Enterprise user
      status (active/suspended). Status is visible in the Members UI or managed indirectly
      via IdP/SCIM.
    reference: no evidence
  session_timeout_configuration:
    value: uncertain — vendor documentation does not describe configurable session
      timeout values for ChatGPT Enterprise. SSO can be enabled/enforced, but no session-length
      controls are documented.
    reference: no evidence
