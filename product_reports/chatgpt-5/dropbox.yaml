incident_response:
  suspend_user_api:
    value: Dropbox Business API supports suspending and unsuspending team members
      via /2/team/members/suspend and /2/team/members/unsuspend; suspension can optionally
      wipe data from linked devices.
    reference: https://developers.dropbox.com/dbx-team-administration-guide
  invalidate_sessions_api:
    value: Uncertain — API exposes devices/session listing for investigation (/2/team/devices/list_member_devices
      and /2/team/devices/list_members_devices) but a documented endpoint to terminate
      specific or all web/device sessions via API was not found; admins can terminate

  user_status_api:
    value: Yes — /2/team/members/list (and get_info) returns each member’s status
      (active, suspended, invited, removed), enabling programmatic checks of user
      state.
    reference: https://developers.dropbox.com/dbx-team-administration-guide
  session_timeout_configuration:
    value: Web Session Control lets admins configure Fixed session length (default
      ~1 month; minimum 1 day) and Idle session length (10 minutes–48 hours) for dropbox.com
      sessions; configured in Admin Console and does not affect desktop/mobile apps.
