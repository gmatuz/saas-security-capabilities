incident_response:
  suspend_user_api:
    value: uncertain — No public Twilio API is documented to suspend/disable individual

      user, reset password, require 2FA) are performed via Twilio Admin UI for Managed
      Users.
    reference: https://www.twilio.com/docs/iam/organizations/managed-users
  invalidate_sessions_api:
    value: uncertain — No documented API to invalidate all Twilio Console sessions
      for a user. For investigation, you can monitor audit events such as user-session.created/updated/deleted
      via the Monitor Events REST API.
    reference: https://www.twilio.com/docs/usage/monitor-events
  revoke_api_key_api:
    value: 'Auth Token rotation is supported via API: promote the secondary Auth Token
      to primary (POST https://accounts.twilio.com/v1/AuthTokens/Promote), which revokes

  user_status_api:
    value: uncertain — No public Users API is documented to fetch a Console user’s
      active/suspended status. You can infer user activity/state changes using the

      auditing.
    reference: https://www.twilio.com/docs/usage/monitor-events
  session_timeout_configuration:
    value: For Twilio Flex SSO, session TTL is governed by the IdP’s SessionNotOnOrAfter
      setting. Twilio advises using a value greater than 1 hour (the default Flex
      token TTL) to avoid unexpected logouts; shorter TTLs can interrupt active sessions.
