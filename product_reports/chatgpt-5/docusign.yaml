incident_response:
  suspend_user_api:
    value: Yes. Admins can programmatically deactivate a user’s membership (soft close)
      in an account using the eSignature REST API Users:delete call; the blog shows
      SDK examples (C#/Java/Node/Python/Ruby/PHP). Reactivation is possible later,
      but requires the user to click an emailed link.
    reference: https://www.docusign.com/blog/developers/common-api-tasks-deactivate-or-close-user-the-docusign-account
  invalidate_sessions_api:
    value: No documented API to invalidate all active sessions for a user. For OAuth
      2.0, DocuSign access tokens expire (about 8 hours) and the older revoke endpoint
      is not applicable; recommended mitigation is to close the user’s membership
      to block access.
    reference: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/69977410/docusign-oauth-revoke-access-token
  revoke_api_key_api:
    value: No public API found to revoke DocuSign integration keys or all user app
      authorizations. Admins can revoke a connected app’s access in the eSignature
      UI (Manage Profile > Connected Apps > Revoke), per Okta’s DocuSign connector
      guidance; requires a super user.
    reference: https://help.okta.com/wf/en-us/Content/Topics/Workflows/connector-reference/docusign/overviews/revoke.htm
  user_toggle_api:
    value: You cannot set userStatus to Enabled/Disabled via API; the supported control
      is to close the user’s membership (blocks account access). Reactivation later
      requires the user to accept via an emailed link.
    reference: https://www.docusign.com/blog/developers/common-api-tasks-deactivate-or-close-user-the-docusign-account
  user_status_api:
    value: Yes. Use Users:list (filter by email/status) to retrieve membership records
      and check userStatus (e.g., Active vs. Closed) and permission profile; the DocuSign
      blog recommends querying by email.
    reference: https://www.docusign.com/blog/developers/the-trenches-may-i-see-your-id
  session_timeout_configuration:
    value: Recipient Signing Session Timeout is configurable at account level under
      Settings > Security Settings (not per-user). Community guidance indicates a
      minimum of 20 minutes for the web-app session timeout.
