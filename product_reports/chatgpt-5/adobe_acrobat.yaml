  - license_level: Acrobat Pro for teams
    active:
      value: yes — billed per license seat under the Teams plan; pricing presented
        as “Starting at” and varies by region/promo.
      reference: https://www.adobe.com/acrobat/business/pricing-plans.html
    suspended_disabled:
      value: No separate ‘suspend’ billing state — you continue paying for purchased
        seats until you reduce license counts at renewal; unassigning/removing a user
        frees the seat for reuse.
      reference: https://helpx.adobe.com/enterprise/using/direct-business-renewals.html
    archived:
      value: No — removed users remain in Directory Users if not permanently deleted;
        costs are tied to seat count, not archived users.

  - license_level: Acrobat for enterprise (ETLA/VIP enterprise)
    active:
      value: unclear — enterprise pricing is contract-based; Adobe directs to Contact
        Sales.
      reference: dubious claim, hallucinated reference
    suspended_disabled:
      value: uncertain — enterprise billing terms depend on contract; no public documentation
        found on charges for disabled/suspended users.
      reference: dubious claim, hallucinated reference
    archived:
      value: uncertain — no explicit public documentation on archived users and billing

security_monitoring:
  event_logs:
    user_login:
      value: 'No vendor documentation indicates that Acrobat (desktop/web) emits user
        login/session audit events. Adobe’s Admin Console Audit Log focuses on admin-
        and org-level actions and, per Adobe employee guidance, does not capture device/session-level
        login information. Therefore, Acrobat-specific user login auditing is not
        available via Admin Console; rely on your IdP for sign-in logs. Status: unavailable
        per community guidance.'

    role_assignment:
      value: Admin Console Audit Log records role and access changes at the org level,
        including admin role assigned/removed, product profile created/edited/deleted,
        and profile assignments to users/groups. These events cover Acrobat entitlement/profile
        changes made in Admin Console (not in-product).
      reference: https://community.adobe.com/t5/enterprise-teams-discussions/introducing-the-admin-audit-log/td-p/12022588
    api_call:
      value: Uncertain—no vendor documentation found for an Acrobat-specific audit
        log of API calls. Admin Console Audit Log explicitly records only organizational
        changes and not product‑specific events; separate Adobe product APIs (e.g.,
        Experience Platform/CJA) have their own audit APIs unrelated to Acrobat.
      reference: https://helpx.adobe.com/enterprise/using/audit-logs.html
    data_export:
      value: Document Cloud asset activities (relevant to Acrobat-managed cloud files)
        are captured in Content Logs, including creation/removal of public links,
        reads of public links, uploads/reads/updates/deletes, collaborator changes,
        and access requests. These can be exported as CSV or streamed in near real

    user_account_creation:
      value: Admin Console Audit Log records user lifecycle events such as user added/removed
        from organization and user group membership changes, which cover Acrobat entitlements
        at the org/profile level.

    security_policy_change:
      value: Security‑relevant policy changes like encryption key enabled/disabled
        and product profile changes are captured in Admin Console Audit Log. No Acrobat
        in‑product policy audit feed is documented.

  event_logs_licensing_level:
    value: Admin Console Audit Log and Content Logs are Admin Console features for
      Enterprise & Teams organizations (system/global admins). Content Logs streaming

incident_response:
  suspend_user_api:
    value: uncertain — No documented UMAPI action to suspend/disable a user account.
      Recommended mitigation is to remove the user from the organization or remove
      product/profile entitlements (e.g., via removeFromOrg), which revokes access
      to Acrobat under the org.
    reference: https://adobe-apiplatform.github.io/umapi-documentation/en/api/ActionsCmds.html
  invalidate_sessions_api:
    value: IMS provides a token revocation endpoint to invalidate an access or refresh
      token (revoking a refresh token also invalidates derived access tokens). There
      is no documented Admin Console/UMAPI capability to kill all sessions for a user
      across devices.
    reference: https://developer.adobe.com/developer-console/docs/guides/authentication/UserAuthentication/ims
  revoke_api_key_api:
    value: Adobe I/O Management API allows programmatic removal of an OAuth Server‑to‑Server
      client secret for a credential (DELETE /console/organizations/{org_id}/credentials/{credential_id}/secrets/{uuid}),
      effectively revoking that secret so new tokens cannot be minted with it.
    reference: dubious claim, hallucinated reference
  user_toggle_api:
    value: uncertain — No official API documented to toggle a user's global status
      between active/suspended. Admins typically revoke access by removing product
      profile assignments or removing the user from the org; community reports indicate
      lack of a direct 'deactivate/suspend' control.

  user_status_api:
    value: UMAPI supports retrieving user details and listing users, and can also
      filter users in a product profile by status=active|inactive, enabling checks
      on whether a user is active within specific product access.
    reference: https://adobe-apiplatform.github.io/umapi-documentation/en/api/getUsersByGroup.html
  session_timeout_configuration:
    value: Admin Console Authentication settings let admins configure Max session
      life (global reauth interval) and Max idle time (auto sign‑out on inactivity)
      for Adobe web apps, explicitly including Acrobat.com.

      membership changes) for incident response playbooks.
    reference: https://github.com/adobe-apiplatform/umapi-client.py
  - value: User Sync Tool — open‑source utility to sync enterprise directory to Admin
      Console; can automate deprovisioning/removal of users and entitlements affecting
      Acrobat access.
    reference: https://github.com/adobe-apiplatform/user-sync.py
  - value: aio-lib-ims (Node.js) — SDK that includes ims.invalidateToken(...) helper
      to programmatically revoke IMS tokens as part of incident response.
    reference: https://github.com/adobe/aio-lib-ims/blob/master/api.md
  - value: Admin Console Audit Log export — export CSV of admin/user/product assignment
