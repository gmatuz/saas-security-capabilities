security_monitoring:
  event_logs:
    user_login:
      value: uncertain – Grammarly exposes a Security Hub UI where users can view
        and manage active sessions/devices, but there’s no vendor-documented audit
        event schema or export for login events.
      reference: dubious claim, hallucinated reference
    role_assignment:
      value: uncertain – Vendor documentation describes roles (admin, account manager,
        group manager, custom roles in Enterprise) but provides no public audit log
        or export of role-assignment changes.
      reference: dubious claim, hallucinated reference
    api_call:
      value: uncertain – Public REST APIs (e.g., Analytics API, License Management
        API) are documented, but no provider-side audit of API invocations or administrative
        API call logs is documented.
      reference: https://developer.grammarly.com/analytics-api.html
    data_export:
      value: Member usage analytics can be exported manually as CSV from the admin
        UI; no evidence of exportable security/audit logs specific to login/admin
        actions.
      reference: dubious claim, hallucinated reference
    configuration_change:
      value: uncertain – Security-related configurations (e.g., Session Timeout, SSO/SCIM)
        are documented, but no public audit logging of configuration changes is documented.
      reference: dubious claim, hallucinated reference
    user_account_creation:
      value: uncertain – Account lifecycle is commonly managed via SCIM/SSO; Microsoft
        Entra ID and other IdPs provide provisioning logs on their side, but no Grammarly-side
        audit export is documented.
      reference: dubious claim, hallucinated reference
    security_policy_change:
      value: uncertain – Enterprise features such as BYOK and Session Timeout are
        available; documentation mentions CloudTrail visibility for key usage (BYOK)
        but no app-level policy change audit log in Grammarly is documented.
      reference: dubious claim, hallucinated reference
  event_logs_licensing_level:
    value: 'uncertain – No vendor-public entitlement for security audit logs found.
      Related items: Analytics API requires Enterprise or Education; SCIM provisioning
      and other enterprise controls (e.g., Session Timeout, BYOK) are Enterprise features.'
    reference: dubious claim, hallucinated reference
  monitoring_products:
  - value: Analytics API (REST) – pull usage metrics (users, sessions) for monitoring
      and external ingestion.
    reference: https://developer.grammarly.com/analytics-api.html
  - value: License Management API (REST) – query subscription summary, list users/last
      activity, and de-provision users programmatically.
    reference: https://developer.grammarly.com/license-management-api.html
  - value: SCIM provisioning with Microsoft Entra ID/Okta/OneLogin – account lifecycle
      events are logged on the IdP side and can be monitored there.
    reference: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/saas-apps/grammarly-provisioning-tutorial
  - value: BYOK with AWS KMS – CloudTrail provides audit logs of key access when Grammarly
      encrypts/decrypts with customer-managed keys.
    reference: dubious claim, hallucinated reference
  - value: Security Hub UI – view/terminate active sessions/devices for basic account-access
      monitoring.
    reference: dubious claim, hallucinated reference
  - value: Unofficial client library (TypeScript) – community project interacting
      with Grammarly services; not an official security log client.
    reference: https://github.com/stewartmcgown/grammarly-api
  ingestion_methods:
  - value: REST pull via Analytics API with OAuth 2.0; endpoint example GET /ecosystem/api/v2/analytics/users;
      JSON responses suitable for SIEM/BI ingestion.
    reference: https://developer.grammarly.com/analytics-api.html
  - value: REST pull via License Management API with OAuth 2.0; endpoints include
      institutions summary and user lists; can complement identity monitoring.
    reference: https://developer.grammarly.com/license-management-api.html
  - value: Manual CSV export from admin Member usage page for usage analytics; periodic
      downloads could be staged into a log pipeline.
    reference: dubious claim, hallucinated reference
  - value: IdP-driven SCIM provisioning (push from IdP) – capture provisioning activity
      from IdP logs (e.g., Microsoft Entra provisioning logs); not a Grammarly log
      stream.
    reference: dubious claim, hallucinated reference
  log_export_options:
    tools_connectors:
      value: uncertain – No vendor-documented SIEM connectors, syslog, streaming,
        or bulk audit-log export for Grammarly application events were found. Available
        outputs include REST APIs (Analytics, License Management) and a manual CSV
        export for usage analytics; BYOK surfaces AWS CloudTrail logs for encryption
        key usage only.

incident_response:
  suspend_user_api:
    value: SCIM-based deprovisioning via your IdP (Okta/Entra/OneLogin/Rippling) will
      deactivate a Grammarly member; when unassigned, Grammarly deactivates the account
      (suspended within ~1 hour) and schedules deletion in 30 days.
    reference: dubious claim, hallucinated reference
  invalidate_sessions_api:
    value: When a user is unassigned via SCIM, Grammarly “will invalidate any authenticated
      sessions” for that member; this provides a programmatic session kill through
      the IdP-to-Grammarly SCIM integration.
    reference: dubious claim, hallucinated reference
  revoke_api_key_api:
    value: uncertain — No public documentation found for revoking/rotating Grammarly
      OAuth client credentials or API keys; available docs cover creating OAuth 2.0
      credentials and scopes only.
    reference: https://developer.grammarly.com/oauth-credentials.html
  user_toggle_api:
    value: Yes via SCIM/IdP — toggling access by deactivating or unassigning a user
      in the IdP marks the Grammarly account deactivated and also invalidates active
      sessions; accounts are later deleted if not re-provisioned.
    reference: dubious claim, hallucinated reference
  user_status_api:
    value: uncertain — The License Management API exposes lists of users with fields
      like email, is_admin, and last_activity_at, but no explicit per-user active/deactivated
      status field is documented.
    reference: https://developer.grammarly.com/license-management-api.html
  session_timeout_configuration:
    value: Session Timeout is available for Grammarly Enterprise and Grammarly for
      Education; configured by Grammarly’s Enterprise team (not self-serve). Timeout
      is set in days (e.g., 14 or 30 days); default recommendation is 30 days.
    reference: dubious claim, hallucinated reference
  known_automation_tools:
  - value: License Management API — programmatically list users/invitees and remove
      users or invitees (DELETE /users/{userId}, /invitees/{inviteeId}); useful to
      automate rapid deprovisioning during incident response.
    reference: https://developer.grammarly.com/license-management-api.html
  - value: SCIM with Microsoft Entra ID — automatic provisioning/deprovisioning; deactivating
      users in Entra deactivates them in Grammarly (unusable login) with deletion
      after 30 days; integrates with SIAM/IGA workflows.
    reference: dubious claim, hallucinated reference
  - value: SCIM with Okta — create/remove users; optional group sync; Okta deactivation
      propagates to Grammarly deactivation and scheduled deletion; enables automated
      offboarding.
    reference: dubious claim, hallucinated reference
  - value: SCIM with OneLogin — configure API integration and choose downstream action
      (Delete/Suspend/Do Nothing) when a OneLogin user is deleted/suspended; supports
      automated lifecycle actions.
    reference: dubious claim, hallucinated reference
  - value: SCIM with Rippling — use a Grammarly SCIM token with Rippling’s configuration
      wizard to automate user create/remove and attribute sync.
    reference: dubious claim, hallucinated reference
  - value: Analytics API — REST API to retrieve organization/user-level Grammarly
      usage metrics (e.g., sessions); useful for investigative enrichment and anomaly
      detection in BI/SIEM pipelines.
    reference: https://developer.grammarly.com/analytics-api.html
  - value: Organization-wide client app controls — Enterprise admins can block specific
      Grammarly client applications (e.g., desktop, browser extensions) across the
      org or groups as a containment action.
    reference: dubious claim, hallucinated reference
