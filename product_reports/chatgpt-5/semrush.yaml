security_monitoring:
  event_logs:
    user_login:
      value: Semrush provides an Activity log that records account-level events including
        user logins. The log is accessible under Profile > Activity log, and in corporate
        (multi-user) accounts under User Management. No public schema is documented.
      reference: dubious claim, hallucinated reference
    role_assignment:
      value: Changes to users' roles are captured in the Activity log under User Management
        for team (corporate) accounts.
      reference: https://www.semrush.com/kb/1411-secure-transparency-team-account
    api_call:
      value: API calls made with your Semrush API key are logged in the Query Log.
        The UI includes an 'Export' control on the API tab to download API history;
        no formal event schema is published.
      reference: https://www.semrush.com/kb/249-query-logs
    data_export:
      value: The Query Log includes records of 'exports' performed in Semrush. This
        provides visibility into export actions; detailed log field schema is not
        documented.
      reference: https://www.semrush.com/kb/249-query-logs
    configuration_change:
      value: Configuration-related activities such as password changes, invitations,
        and changes to usage limits are recorded in the Activity log; exact field
        schema is not published.
      reference: dubious claim, hallucinated reference
    user_account_creation:
      value: For corporate accounts, the Activity Log tracks user management lifecycle
        events (e.g., invitations, users joining or leaving the account), which evidences
        administrative user additions/removals.
      reference: https://www.semrush.com/news/270968-semrush-corporate-plans-create-your-own-product/
    security_policy_change:
      value: uncertain — Documentation confirms Activity log entries for logins, password
        changes, and reactivation; there is no published evidence that changes to
        security policies (e.g., enabling/disabling 2FA, account security settings)
        are logged.
      reference: https://www.semrush.com/kb/1411-secure-transparency-team-account
  event_logs_licensing_level:
    value: Viewing your own Activity and Query logs is available via Profile. For
      multi-user visibility (subuser Activity/Query logs), a corporate (multi-user)
      account is required; the help article does not state an additional paid add‑on
      specifically for audit logs. No separate licensing for logs is documented.
    reference: dubious claim, hallucinated reference
  monitoring_products:
  - value: Semrush Activity Log (built-in UI) — shows logins, password changes, invitations,
      role changes for account/corporate contexts; no native SIEM connector is documented.
    reference: https://www.semrush.com/kb/1411-secure-transparency-team-account
  - value: Semrush Query Log (built-in UI) — lists queries, API calls, and exports;
      supports exporting API history from the API tab.
    reference: https://www.semrush.com/kb/249-query-logs
  - value: Unofficial Python client for Semrush Analytics API — suitable for analytics
      data retrieval; no evidence of endpoints for Activity/Query Log export, so not
      a security log client.
    reference: https://github.com/storerjeremy/python-semrush
  - value: Unofficial Node.js client for Semrush API (node-semrush / semrush-api)
      — analytics-only; no documented support for security/audit logs.
    reference: https://github.com/ithinkdancan/node-semrush
  ingestion_methods:
  - value: 'Manual export from Query Log: the API tab in Query Log provides an ''Export''
      button to download API history for offline processing.'
    reference: https://www.semrush.com/kb/249-query-logs
  - value: Semrush Standard/Projects/Trends APIs via API key (Business tier add‑on)
      provide analytics/project data access; no documented endpoints for Activity
      or Query Log export.
    reference: https://www.semrush.com/kb/5-api
  - value: No official SIEM/webhook/syslog connectors are listed among Semrush’s supported
      integrations, implying custom collection would rely on manual exports or bespoke
      scripts.
    reference: https://pt.semrush.com/kb/931-integrations
  log_export_options:
    tools_connectors:
      value: The Query Log UI supports exporting API history via an in‑app control;
        Activity log export is not documented. Outside of logs, Semrush tools commonly
        support CSV/XLSX/PDF exports, but no FTP or streaming export options are documented
        for logs.

incident_response:
  suspend_user_api:
    value: Uncertain — no public Semrush API documented to suspend/deactivate users.
      Admins can remove users via the User Management UI (Owner/Admin role can Add/Remove
      users).
    reference: https://www.semrush.com/kb/1409-user-management
  invalidate_sessions_api:
    value: Uncertain — no documentation of an API to invalidate user sessions. Semrush
      describes accounts being auto-disabled by security systems and re-enabled after
      password reset; no session kill controls are documented.
    reference: https://help.semrush.com/FAQ/en/articles/5265853-why-is-my-account-disabled
  revoke_api_key_api:
    value: Uncertain — documentation shows how to locate the API key and warns not
      to share it; no public method to revoke/rotate keys is documented.
    reference: https://www.semrush.com/kb/92-api-key
  user_toggle_api:
    value: Uncertain — no public API to toggle a user's status. Account owners/admins
      can remove users via the UI; API docs cover analytics/projects only.
    reference: https://www.semrush.com/kb/1409-user-management
  user_status_api:
    value: Uncertain — no public API to query user status. Investigation via UI Activity
      log shows logins, password changes, reactivation; Query log shows tool/API requests.
    reference: dubious claim, hallucinated reference
  session_timeout_configuration:
    value: Uncertain — no documentation found on configurable session timeout values.
      Related guidance covers login issues, account disablement, and password reset—not
      session timeout settings.
    reference: dubious claim, hallucinated reference
  known_automation_tools:
  - value: Zapier Semrush integration — automation triggers/actions for Site Audit
      (e.g., trigger on 'Completed Site Audit', create/re-crawl campaigns); can be
      used to orchestrate Semrush workflows (not IR-specific).
    reference: https://zapier.com/apps/semrush/integrations/airops
  - value: Tray.io Semrush connector (with Splunk via universal connector) — provides
      Semrush operations (get keywords, backlinks, etc.) and generic HTTP/webhook
      to push data toward SIEM like Splunk; marketing data automation, not security
      IR.
    reference: https://tray.ai/connectors/semrush-splunk-integrations
  - value: Pipedream workflows — example page showing Okta API + Semrush API in one
      workflow; demonstrates orchestrating Semrush API calls with identity events
      (no Semrush IR endpoints).
    reference: https://pipedream.com/apps/okta/integrations/semrush
  - value: Listing Management API — official Semrush API for bulk location data updates;
      demonstrates authenticated write operations to Semrush (not user/security admin).
    reference: https://www.semrush.com/kb/1420-listing-management-api
  - value: python-semrush (GitHub) — Python wrapper for Semrush API v3; useful for
      automating data pulls and custom scripts (analytics/projects only).
    reference: https://github.com/storerjeremy/python-semrush
  - value: semrush-api (npm) — Node.js client exposing Semrush API endpoints for automation
      scripts; analytics use cases, not account security.
    reference: https://www.npmjs.com/package/semrush-api
  - value: semrush_ruby (GitHub) — Ruby client for Semrush API (e.g., backlinks endpoints);
      can be embedded in bespoke automation.
    reference: https://github.com/capitalist/semrush_ruby
  - value: SEMrushR (GitHub) — R package to query Semrush via API; supports analytics
      pulls for data workflows.
