  suspend_user_api:
    value: 'ClickUp provides an Enterprise-only API endpoint to deactivate (remove)
      a user from a Workspace: DELETE /api/v2/team/{team_id}/user/{user_id}. This
      effectively suspends Workspace access for the specified user.'
    reference: https://developer.clickup.com/reference/removeuserfromworkspace
  invalidate_sessions_api:
    value: No documented API to invalidate user sessions. Admins on Enterprise can
      enforce session timeouts; changing session duration from “Never expires” immediately
      signs everyone out of ClickUp. Users can also log out of all sessions via their
      account settings UI.
    reference: dubious claim, hallucinated reference
  revoke_api_key_api:
    value: Personal API tokens “never expire” and are generated/regenerated in the
      UI; there is no documented API to revoke or rotate personal tokens. OAuth access
      tokens currently do not expire, and revocation is handled by removing the app/authorization
      rather than via a published revoke endpoint.
    reference: https://developer.clickup.com/docs/authentication
  user_toggle_api:
    value: An Enterprise-only API endpoint allows updating a user’s role on a Workspace
      (e.g., admin flag or custom_role_id) via PUT /api/v2/team/{team_id}/user/{user_id}.
      This changes privileges but documentation does not state it terminates existing
      sessions. To fully block access use the Remove User endpoint.
    reference: https://developer.clickup.com/reference/edituseronworkspace
  user_status_api:
    value: An Enterprise-only API endpoint GET /api/v2/team/{team_id}/user/{user_id}
      returns information about a user in a Workspace, which can be used to check
      their presence and details programmatically.
    reference: https://developer.clickup.com/reference/getuser
  session_timeout_configuration:
    value: Session Management (Enterprise only) lets owners/admins set global session
      duration (1 hour to 30 days, or Never) and idle timeout (15 minutes to 4 hours).
      Switching from “Never expires” logs everyone out immediately; otherwise changes
      apply on next session.
