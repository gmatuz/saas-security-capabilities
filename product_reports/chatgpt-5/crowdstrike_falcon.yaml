security_monitoring:
  event_logs:
    user_login:
      value: CrowdStrike Falcon records administrative user authentications in the
        Falcon UI Audit Trail and makes these available in Event Search (Audit tab).
        Events include fields such as OperationName (e.g., twoFactorAuthenticate),
        ServiceName ("CrowdStrike Authentication"), UserId, UserIp, and Success, and
        can be streamed via the Event Streams/API-backed integrations.
      reference: https://www.reddit.com/r/crowdstrike/comments/shx47z
    role_assignment:

        and AuditKeyValues; this enables monitoring of console actions and API-driven
        changes.
      reference: https://docs.panther.com/data-onboarding/supported-logs/crowdstrike/event-streams
    data_export:
      value: uncertain
      reference: no evidence
    configuration_change:
      value: The Falcon platform emits audit events for console configuration changes
        (e.g., host groups and other admin actions are visible in the Audit dashboard
        when Falcon Insight is enabled), allowing “who/what/when” tracking of modifications.
      reference: https://www.reddit.com/r/crowdstrike/comments/ofqkcz
    user_account_creation:
      value: Creation of new Falcon administrative users appears in audit activity;

        UserActivity audit events for tracking who created users or API clients.
      reference: https://github.com/Marchelled/csfalcon
    security_policy_change:
      value: Policy modifications are logged as UserActivity audit events with ServiceName
        identifying the policy family and OperationName describing the action (e.g.,
        ServiceName=device_control_policy and OperationName=update_class_action),
        suitable for alerting or scheduled searches.

incident_response:
  suspend_user_api:
    value: uncertain — No documented API endpoint to suspend/disable a Falcon console
      user. The User Management API exposes actions limited to resetting a user’s
      password or 2FA (POST /user-management/entities/user-actions/v1) and supports
      permanent deletion of users (DELETE /users/entities/users/v1).
    reference: https://docs.falconpy.io/Service-Collections/User-Management.html
  invalidate_sessions_api:
    value: Falcon Fusion SOAR integrations provide identity-session revocation for
      user compromise via Microsoft Entra ID actions (e.g., “Revoke Existing Sign-in
      Sessions”). This is implemented as Fusion SOAR response actions, not as a public
      Falcon-console session invalidation API.
    reference: https://marketplace.crowdstrike.com/listings/microsoft-entra-id-soar-actions
  revoke_api_key_api:
    value: uncertain — Evidence indicates there is no public API to rotate or revoke
      OAuth2 API client credentials programmatically; rotation is performed by creating
      a new API client and removing the old one in the Falcon UI. Community confirmation
      from FalconPy maintainer states no endpoint is available for key rotation.
    reference: https://www.reddit.com/r/crowdstrike/comments/w7sly0
  user_toggle_api:
    value: uncertain — No disable/enable endpoint is documented for Falcon console
      users. Available mitigations include revoking roles (DELETE /user-roles/entities/user-roles/v1)
      and deleting the user (DELETE /users/entities/users/v1). It is not documented
      that these actions invalidate existing Falcon UI sessions.
    reference: https://docs.falconpy.io/Service-Collections/User-Management.html
  user_status_api:
    value: APIs exist to retrieve users and role assignments (e.g., RetrieveUser,
      retrieve_user_uuids_by_cid) to validate user existence and privileges. An explicit
      active/suspended state isn’t documented in accessible references.
    reference: https://docs.falconpy.io/Service-Collections/User-Management.html
  session_timeout_configuration:
    value: Console session behavior can be altered in the UI using the dashboard’s
      Settings > Display > “Stay Signed In” toggle; community reports default timeouts
      around 10–15 minutes without it. Minimum configurable values are not documented.
