security_monitoring:
  event_logs:
    user_login:
      value: Sign-on (authentication) activity is available via Workday SignOn logs
        and can be exported for SIEM. Example fields include Authentication_Type_for_Signon,
        Session_IP_Address, Failed_Signon, Session_ID, and timestamps; vendors collect
        these in JSON via Workday APIs.
      reference: https://help.sumologic.com/docs/integrations/saas-cloud/workday/
    role_assignment:
      value: Security group membership changes are auditable. Workday provides a Security
        History for Users report (2025 R1) showing security events, affected security
        group, whether access was granted or revoked, who completed the change, and
        precise timestamps.
      reference: https://www.pwc.com/us/en/technology/alliances/library/workday-security-history.html
    api_call:
      value: API usage is visible in User Activity logs; vendors expose an API Activity
        view and recommend filtering User Activity where the task contains 'api/'.
        Collected fields include action (READ/WRITE), task identifiers, IP address,
        session ID, and request time, enabling monitoring of REST/Web Service calls.
      reference: https://help.sumologic.com/docs/integrations/saas-cloud/workday/
    data_export:
      value: Report downloads and similar data export actions are captured in User
        Activity (e.g., 'Download' entries for report exports), enabling auditing
        of who exported what within the 30‑day user activity retention window unless
        offloaded to a SIEM.
      reference: https://www.reddit.com/r/workday/comments/1gbpqil
    configuration_change:
      value: Configuration changes (business processes, custom reports, integrations,
        domain security policies, and user-based security groups) are auditable. Workday’s
        Configuration Change Tracker (released 2024 R2, expanded 2025 R2) and audit
        trail reports provide detailed change records with user, object, attribute
        changes, and timestamps.
      reference: https://www.pwc.com/us/en/technology/alliances/library/workday-configuration-change-tracker.html
    user_account_creation:
      value: Account creation activities can be monitored via audit and event data
        tied to business processes (e.g., 'Create Workday Account') and captured through
        reporting/integration-driven event polling in third‑party tooling.
      reference: https://docs.rapid7.com/insightconnect/workday/
    security_policy_change:
      value: Security policy changes are auditable (e.g., Domain Security Policy History,
        Business Process Security Policy History). Standard audit reports and tagging
        approaches are used to monitor and evidence changes over time.
      reference: https://www.pwc.com/us/en/technology/alliances/library/workday-configuration-control.html
  event_logs_licensing_level:
    value: Uncertain—public sources document prerequisites rather than licensing.
      Access relies on enabling User Activity Logging and OAuth 2.0 and granting System
      Auditing permissions; vendor add‑ons (e.g., Splunk) are distributed separately
      from the Workday Service.
