  invalidate_sessions_api:
    value: No public endpoint found to programmatically invalidate a user’s active

  user_toggle_api:
    value: Yes via SCIM deactivation/reactivation through the IdP. Toggling a user

      retrieve org user status; admins see ‘Last active’ in the People UI. SCIM may

  session_timeout_configuration:

      14 days (default automatic logout after 21 days of inactivity). Timeouts log
      users out across web, desktop, mobile, embeds, and integrations; the shortest
