security_monitoring:
  event_logs:
    user_login:
      value: Zoho CRM’s audit log does not record user sign-ins. Login history is
        captured in Zoho Directory and is accessed from Zoho CRM via Setup > Security
        Control > Login History; use this for monitoring sign-ins.
      reference: https://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/faqs/audit-log/articles/audit-logs-3-2-2023
    role_assignment:
      value: Audit Log captures setup changes to Roles, Profiles, and Groups (create/edit),
        enabling tracking of authorization model changes performed in CRM.
      reference: https://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/security-control/audit-log/articles/monitor-audit-log
    api_call:
      value: API activity is monitored via the Zoho CRM API Dashboard, which provides
        usage statistics by user, IP address, module, method, and time with ~30 days
        retention; it is a usage dashboard rather than a per-call security audit event
        stream.
      reference: https://www.zoho.com/crm/developer/docs/api/v8/dashboards.html
    data_export:
      value: Export actions are included in the Audit Log (bulk and individual), allowing
        visibility into record exports from modules. Separate data export tooling
        exists under Data Administration for module exports.
      reference: https://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/faqs/audit-log/articles/audit-logs-3-2-2023

        Workflow Rules (create/edit/delete/lock with ‘View changes’), Webhooks, Assignment
        Rules, Auto-response rules, Reports, Business Hours, etc.
      reference: https://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/security-control/audit-log/articles/monitor-audit-log
    user_account_creation:
      value: User administration events are audited; the Audit Log lists Users (Add,
        Edit Details) so creation/updates of CRM user accounts are captured.
      reference: https://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/security-control/audit-log/articles/monitor-audit-log
    security_policy_change:
      value: uncertain — documentation enumerates many setup/change events but does
        not explicitly confirm auditing of CRM security policy changes (e.g., Allowed
        IPs/MFA policy). Login history and some security controls are handled in Zoho
        Directory.
      reference: https://help.zoho.com/portal/en/kb/crm/security-control/audit-log/articles/monitor-audit-log
  event_logs_licensing_level:
