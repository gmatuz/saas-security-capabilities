      AD, ADFS, Okta, Shibboleth). Zoom documents SAML-based SSO configuration, including
      signed/encrypted assertions and client session controls; no Kerberos documented;

      OAuth; Microsoft Entra guidance notes legacy Bearer Authentication is no longer
      supported.

      reference: https://www.postman.com/zoom-developer/zoom-public-workspace/request/7okmfpb/get-operation-logs-report
    api_call:
      value: API call visibility exists in the Marketplace “API Call Logs,” which
        display up to 100 calls from the last 7 days for developer troubleshooting;
        no security-audit-grade API for comprehensive API-call logging is documented.
      reference: https://medium.com/zoom-developer-blog/transitioning-your-developer-apps-to-zooms-marketplace-6a8de3386716
    data_export:
      value: uncertain — forum guidance indicates no API endpoint to retrieve cloud
        recording view/download counts, and no explicit audit log of data export actions
        is documented via the Reports API.
      reference: https://devforum.zoom.us/t/get-details-of-recordings-views-and-downloads/30670

      reference: https://www.postman.com/zoom-developer/zoom-public-workspace/request/7okmfpb/get-operation-logs-report
    security_policy_change:
      value: Security-relevant policy changes (for example, changing account settings
        or SSO-related admin actions) are recorded in audit/operation logs and can
        be ingested; Datadog’s integration explicitly consumes Operation Logs for
        such changes.

incident_response:
  suspend_user_api:
    value: Yes. Zoom provides an API to toggle a user's account status. PUT /users/{userId}/status
      supports action=deactivate or action=activate. Deactivating removes licenses
      and prevents the user from logging in; the user can later be reactivated.
    reference: https://www.postman.com/zoom-developer/zoom-public-workspace/request/507i12l/update-user-status
  invalidate_sessions_api:
    value: Limited. There is no general API to sign a user out of Zoom across all
      devices/sessions. Zoom staff confirm the only programmatic logout is DELETE
      /users/{userId}/token, which revokes an SSO user’s session; otherwise, there
      is no API to log a user out. Use the admin/user UI to sign out of sessions.
    reference: https://devforum.zoom.us/t/rest-api-for-zoom-sign-out/5998
  revoke_api_key_api:
    value: OAuth access/refresh tokens for Zoom Marketplace apps can be programmatically
      revoked via POST https://zoom.us/oauth/revoke (Basic auth with client_id:client_secret
      and token in x-www-form-urlencoded body). This revokes app access. Unclear for
      other token types (e.g., ZAK/user tokens) beyond SSO-token revoke; no evidence
      of a general 'API key' revoke for Server-to-Server OAuth credentials via API.
    reference: https://www.postman.com/zoom-developer/zoom-public-workspace/request/9tpyk7i/revoke-an-access-token
  user_toggle_api:
    value: Yes. You can programmatically toggle a user between active and deactivated
      with PUT /users/{userId}/status. Deactivation prevents login; however, uncertain
      whether it immediately terminates existing sessions—Zoom docs do not state forced
      logout. Use UI 'Managing signed-in devices and sessions' to force sign-out if
      needed. (uncertain about immediate session termination)
    reference: https://www.postman.com/zoom-developer/zoom-public-workspace/request/507i12l/update-user-status
  user_status_api:
    value: Yes. The List users API supports a status query (active | inactive | pending)
      and returns each user’s status, allowing you to check if an account is active
      vs. deactivated.
    reference: https://www.postman.com/zoom-developer/zoom-public-workspace/request/sox1x04/list-users
  session_timeout_configuration:
    value: Zoom account security settings allow enforced automatic sign-out after
      inactivity. Admins can set 'Users need to sign in again after a period of inactivity'
      for the web portal (10–120 minutes) and Zoom client (5–120 minutes). There’s
      also 'Automatically sign users out after a specified time' (Zoom-password-based).
