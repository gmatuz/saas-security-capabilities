  event_logs:
    user_login:
      value: Trello does not expose product-level login events to customers; board/Workspace
        exports and activity do not include login details. Login-related events must
        be sourced from Atlassian organization audit logs rather than Trello product

        event is recorded when exports are performed; availability of export audit
        events is uncertain.

      reference: https://support.atlassian.com/organization-administration/docs/track-organization-activities-from-the-audit-log/
    security_policy_change:

incident_response:
  suspend_user_api:
    value: Atlassian SCIM user provisioning API supports deactivating (deprovisioning)
      a managed user in Atlassian Cloud; DELETE /scim/directory/{directoryId}/Users/{userId}
      deactivates the user, which applies across Atlassian apps including Trello (requires
      Atlassian Guard/SCIM).

    value: Enterprise administrators can deactivate a Trello Enterprise member (license
      removal) from the Enterprise Admin Dashboard; deactivation removes access and
      terminates related SSO sessions so the user is logged out.
    reference: https://trello.com/pt-BR/guide/enterprise/admins-dashboard
  user_status_api:
    value: Atlassian SCIM User APIs expose the ‘active’ attribute on users and allow
      GET /scim/directory/{directoryId}/Users/{userId} to check if a user is active
      vs. deactivated.
    reference: https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/admin/user-provisioning/rest/api-group-users/
  session_timeout_configuration:
