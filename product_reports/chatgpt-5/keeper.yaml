incident_response:
  suspend_user_api:
    value: Commander CLI provides an enterprise-user command to programmatically lock

      is the documented method for suspending users via automation.

  invalidate_sessions_api:
    value: 'uncertain - No explicit vendor documentation found for an API to forcibly
      invalidate all active sessions for a user. Related behavior: role enforcement
      changes to the logout timer can modify current sessions across device types
      immediately after policy changes, but this is not a direct “terminate all sessions”
      API.'
    reference: https://docs.keeper.io/en/release-notes/backend/backend-api/backend-api-16.9.9
  revoke_api_key_api:
    value: Keeper Secrets Manager uses Applications and Clients, not personal API
      keys. Access can be revoked programmatically by removing a client device from
      an application (secrets-manager client remove) or deleting the application (secrets-manager
      app remove), which revokes the client’s ability to access secrets; one-time
      access tokens are also used during onboarding.

  user_status_api:
    value: The user-report command generates ad-hoc user status reports (e.g., last
      login, status) and can export to CSV/JSON for investigations.
    reference: https://docs.keeper.io/en/keeperpam/commander-cli/command-reference/reporting-commands
  session_timeout_configuration:
    value: Logout timer behavior is controlled by role enforcements; timers may be
      set by device type and values up to 30 days are supported. Lowering the max
      allowed logout timer can modify current sessions for affected users.
    reference: https://docs.keeper.io/en/release-notes/backend/backend-api/backend-api-16.9.9
  known_automation_tools:
