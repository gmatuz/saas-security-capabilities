security_monitoring:
  event_logs:
    user_login:
      value: Pipedrive records user session/device activity (device, location/IP,
        login method, login and logout timestamps) in the Security dashboard. Admins
        can review the “Active devices” and “Device history” views and export results
        to CSV/XLSX; retention shown is the past two months for device history.
      reference: https://support.pipedrive.com/en/article/how-can-i-see-which-devices-i-have-used-to-access-pipedrive
    role_assignment:
      value: Role/permission changes can be monitored via webhooks on the user object.
        The “updated.user” webhook payload includes fields like role_id, enabling
        detection of role assignment changes when persisted to a log store.
      reference: https://devcommunity.pipedrive.com/t/user-creation-events-solved/1706
    api_call:
      value: No documented per-request audit trail of API calls was found. Pipedrive
        provides an “API usage dashboard” in Company Settings that shows counts of
        requests by app and by user for the last 30 days, but not request/response
        detail.
      reference: https://community.pipedrive.com/discussion/16733/new-api-usage-dashboard
    data_export:
      value: Pipedrive supports manual data exports to CSV/XLSX (including a Users
        and access export that contains last login time). Documentation does not state
        that export actions themselves are logged as audit events; status is uncertain.
      reference: https://support.pipedrive.com/en/article/exporting-data-from-pipedrive
    configuration_change:
      value: The Security dashboard contains an Audit log listing “security-related
        changes” with fields (User, Event, Type, Time) and export to spreadsheet.
        Public docs do not enumerate exact configuration change event types; coverage
        specifics are uncertain.
      reference: https://support.pipedrive.com/en/article/security-dashboard
    user_account_creation:
      value: Account creation/deletion/changes for company users can be streamed via
        webhooks (e.g., create/change/delete on the user object), which can be ingested
        by external logging/SIEM pipelines.
      reference: https://pipedrive.readme.io/docs/list-of-webhooks-v2
    security_policy_change:
      value: Pipedrive Enterprise offers Security rules (e.g., 2FA enforcement, password
        policy, IP/time-based access). While the Audit log reports “security-related
        changes,” documentation does not explicitly confirm policy-change event entries;
        uncertain.
      reference: https://support.pipedrive.com/en/article/security-rules-access-restrictions
  event_logs_licensing_level:
    value: The Security dashboard exists across plans but key logging features (Active
      devices, Device history, Audit log) are Enterprise features. “Last 7 days” summary
      and Security assessment are available on all plans.
    reference: https://support.pipedrive.com/en/article/security-dashboard
  monitoring_products:
  - value: Official Webhooks for streaming Pipedrive events (including user create/update/delete)
      to external endpoints for monitoring/SIEM ingestion.
    reference: https://pipedrive.readme.io/docs/guide-for-webhooks-v2
  - value: n8n workflow integration offering a Pipedrive node and Splunk node to forward
      Pipedrive events/data to Splunk.
    reference: https://n8n.io/integrations/pipedrive/and/splunk/
  - value: Tray.io iPaaS provides connectors/HTTP capabilities to integrate Pipedrive
      with Splunk for automated forwarding.
    reference: https://tray.ai/connectors/pipedrive-splunk-integrations
  - value: Official Node.js SDK to programmatically access Users, Webhooks and other
      endpoints for building custom collectors.
    reference: https://github.com/pipedrive/client-nodejs
  - value: Open-source webhook listener example for Pipedrive to receive and process
      events externally (extendable to forward to SIEM).
    reference: https://github.com/opsmill/pipedrive-webhook-listener
  ingestion_methods:
  - value: Webhooks push JSON to your endpoint (HTTP POST) for selected objects/actions
      (including user create/change/delete). Can be persisted or forwarded to SIEMs.
    reference: https://pipedrive.readme.io/docs/guide-for-webhooks-v2
  - value: Manual export of Device history and Audit log from the Security dashboard
      to CSV/XLSX for batch ingestion.
    reference: https://support.pipedrive.com/en/article/security-dashboard
  - value: “Users and access” export (CSV/XLSX) includes user list with last login
      time, permission sets and visibility groups for ingestion.
    reference: https://support.pipedrive.com/en/article/exporting-data-from-pipedrive
  - value: General REST API (SDKs available) to pull admin/user metadata (e.g., users,
      roles). No dedicated audit-log API documented.
    reference: https://developers.pipedrive.com/docs/api/v1
  log_export_options:
    tools_connectors:
      value: Exports available via UI as CSV/XLSX (including Users and access). Streaming
        via Webhooks to any HTTP endpoint. No native SIEM connector documented; third-party
        iPaaS (e.g., n8n, Tray.io) or custom HEC/webhook receivers are typical patterns.

incident_response:
  suspend_user_api:
    value: uncertain — No dedicated 'deactivate/suspend user' API is documented. The
      Users API only allows updating active_flag via PUT /v1/users/{id}; docs describe
      it as 'false = Not activated, true = Activated' (activation state), not an explicit
      suspension/deactivation control.
    reference: https://developers.pipedrive.com/docs/api/v1/Users
  invalidate_sessions_api:
    value: No public API to log out users or invalidate sessions; Pipedrive staff
      confirmed 'No, we don’t offer any logout endpoint' for programmatic logout.
    reference: https://devcommunity.pipedrive.com/t/logout-endpoint/2054
  revoke_api_key_api:
    value: uncertain — No evidence of a public API to revoke or rotate personal API
      tokens programmatically. For OAuth-based marketplace apps, tokens can be revoked
      via POST https://oauth.pipedrive.com/oauth/revoke (RFC 7009) to invalidate access/refresh
      tokens.
    reference: https://pipedrive.readme.io/docs/app-uninstallation
  user_toggle_api:
    value: uncertain — Only active_flag is updatable via PUT /v1/users/{id}; docs
      define it as activation status ('Not activated' vs 'Activated'). No documentation
      confirms this toggles an already-active user to a suspended/disabled state or
      its effect on sessions.
    reference: https://developers.pipedrive.com/docs/api/v1/Users
  user_status_api:
    value: Yes — Users API supports GET /v1/users and GET /v1/users/{id} returning
      fields including active_flag and (in responses) is_deleted, allowing programmatic
      checks of user state.
    reference: https://developers.pipedrive.com/docs/api/v1/Users
  session_timeout_configuration:
    value: Login sessions last 30 days when 'Remember me'/Google/SSO is used; otherwise
      12 hours. Each user can be logged in on at most three devices. Forced device
      logout is done via UI (Security Center/Devices), not via API.
    reference: https://support.pipedrive.com/es/article/why-does-pipedrive-log-me-out
  known_automation_tools:
  - value: Pipedrive Webhooks — Create and manage webhooks via API (POST /v1/webhooks)
      to push user/deal/person/etc. change events to external endpoints (e.g., SIEM/SOAR)
      with retry and delivery semantics.
    reference: https://pipedrive.readme.io/docs/guide-for-webhooks
  - value: Official Node.js SDK (pipedrive/client-nodejs) — Client library supporting
      OAuth2 and API token auth to automate Users (GET/PUT), PermissionSets, and other
      endpoints for response workflows.
    reference: https://github.com/pipedrive/client-nodejs
  - value: pipedrivepy (PyPI) — Python client for the Pipedrive API (sync/async) suitable
      for scripting investigation/response actions (e.g., user lookups, permission
      queries).
    reference: https://pypi.org/project/pipedrivepy/
  - value: n8n Pipedrive + Splunk — Workflow/iPaaS integration showing automation
      paths to forward Pipedrive events to Splunk for monitoring/response.
    reference: https://n8n.io/integrations/pipedrive/and/splunk/
  - value: Webhook listener example (opsmill/pipedrive-webhook-listener) — Open-source
      Flask listener illustrating how to receive Pipedrive webhooks (v2) and perform
      automated actions; can be adapted for IR pipelines.
    reference: https://github.com/opsmill/pipedrive-webhook-listener
  - value: PermissionSets API — Programmatically list permission sets and assignments
      to audit/adjust access during an incident (supports /v1/permissionSets and related
      endpoints).
