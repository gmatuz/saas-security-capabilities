security_monitoring:
  event_logs:
    user_login:
      value: Audit logs for administrative access exist and can be forwarded to a
        SIEM by enabling Remote Syslog in Logs and Reports > Log Settings; SIEM guidance
        explicitly instructs collecting 'all audit logs and system events' from Proofpoint
        Enterprise Protection (Protection Server) via Syslog.
      reference: https://www.juniper.net/documentation/us/en/software/jsa7.5.0/jsa-dsm/topics/task/jsa-dsm-configuring-proofpoint-enterprise-protection-and.html
    role_assignment:
      value: uncertain – no public vendor documentation found confirming whether administrator
        role/permission assignments are captured as discrete audit events in Protection
        Server.
      reference: no evidence
    api_call:
      value: uncertain – no public evidence that Protection Server records audit events
        for administrative/business API calls; on-prem logging appears centered on
        filter/MTA/syslog streams rather than API call auditing.
      reference: no evidence
    data_export:
      value: uncertain – no public documentation confirming that administrative data/configuration
        export actions generate explicit audit events in Protection Server.
      reference: no evidence
    configuration_change:
      value: Community reports indicate a 'Configuration Log' that records configuration
        changes with before/after details (e.g., policy/rule edits) in Protection
        Server; public vendor docs are not available for this capability.
      reference: https://www.reddit.com/r/proofpoint/comments/1d3w32d
    user_account_creation:
      value: uncertain – no public vendor documentation found confirming that creation
        of administrative user accounts is logged as an audit event in Protection
        Server.
      reference: no evidence
    security_policy_change:
      value: Community reports suggest policy/rule changes appear in the Protection
        Server 'Configuration Log' with change details, implying auditability of security
        policy changes.
      reference: https://www.reddit.com/r/proofpoint/comments/1d3w32d
  event_logs_licensing_level:
    value: For Proofpoint on Demand (PoD), Remote Syslog forwarding requires a separate
      'Remote Syslog Forwarding' license; the Proofpoint Email Security Add-On for
      Splunk notes PoD requires this license, while hardware/virtual Protection Server
      uses built‑in syslog settings under Logs and Reports > Log Settings. Some SIEM
      integrations with PoD use the Log API, which requires service principal credentials
      (often created in the portal or via support).

incident_response:
  suspend_user_api:
    value: uncertain — The Cortex XSOAR “Proofpoint Protection Server v2” integration
      exposes user CRUD (get/create/modify/delete) via REST on port 10000, but no
      documentation indicates a specific “suspend/disable” toggle; only modify-user
      with free-form fields/attributes is shown.
    reference: https://xsoar.pan.dev/docs/reference/integrations/proofpoint-protection-server-v2
  invalidate_sessions_api:
    value: uncertain — No vendor or integration documentation found describing an
      API to invalidate active end-user or admin sessions in Proofpoint Protection
      Server.
    reference: no evidence
  revoke_api_key_api:
    value: No API key lifecycle documented for Protection Server; the XSOAR integration
      authenticates with username/password to the PPS REST service (admins require
      an API-enabled role), not API tokens/keys.
    reference: https://xsoar.pan.dev/docs/reference/integrations/proofpoint-protection-server-v2
  user_toggle_api:
    value: uncertain — User “modify” exists, but no explicit field is documented to
      flip a user’s active/suspended state; available attributes are not detailed
      publicly.
    reference: https://xsoar.pan.dev/docs/reference/integrations/proofpoint-protection-server-v2
  user_status_api:
    value: Partial capability — get-user returns a user profile (email, uid, groups,
      safelist/blocklist, timestamps like lastsignon). This can confirm existence
      and some state, but no explicit “active/suspended” status is documented.
    reference: https://xsoar.pan.dev/docs/reference/integrations/proofpoint-protection-server-v2
