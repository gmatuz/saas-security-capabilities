incident_response:
  suspend_user_api:
    value: SCIM 2.0 provisioning (Enterprise plan with SSO enabled) allows IdP-driven
      user deactivation or deletion; deactivation removes the user's ability to log
      in and schedule, and deletion removes the user from the organization.
    reference: dubious claim, hallucinated reference
  invalidate_sessions_api:
    value: uncertain – No documented per-user session invalidation API. Enabling SAML
      SSO signs out all users, and session duration can be shortened in Calendly settings;
      SCIM deactivation prevents future logins.
    reference: https://calendly.com/security/
  revoke_api_key_api:
    value: OAuth access tokens can be revoked programmatically via a POST to the revoke
      access/refresh token endpoint; personal access tokens are revoked via the Calendly
      UI (API & Webhooks). Tokens are also revoked automatically when login email,
      password, or login method changes.
    reference: https://developer.calendly.com/frequently-asked-questions
  user_toggle_api:
    value: Use SCIM 'active' attribute (from IdP) to toggle user access. Mapping sets
      Active=true to allow login and Active=false to disable the user; requires Enterprise
      with SSO and SCIM enabled.
    reference: dubious claim, hallucinated reference
  user_status_api:
    value: uncertain – Calendly v2 API exposes organization_memberships for enumerating
      users but no documented 'active/suspended' flag; user activation state is managed
      via SCIM at the IdP. Membership listing returns role and user details only.
    reference: https://www.postman.com/calendlyapi/calendly-s-api-collection/request/ysfe1uj/list-organization-memberships
  session_timeout_configuration:
    value: SAML SSO session timeout defaults to 21 days and can be shortened in Calendly;
      session duration resets with user activity. Enabling SSO signs out all users.
