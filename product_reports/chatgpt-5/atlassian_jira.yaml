    role_assignment:
      value: Jira Cloud product audit logs capture group and permission changes (for
        example, 'User added to group' under the 'user management' category). The

        timing, which supports security visibility into API usage.

        (e.g., GROUP), remoteAddress, and created timestamp.
      reference: https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/rest/v2/api-group-audit-records/
    security_policy_change:
      value: Organization-level audit logs track security-policy activities (for example,
        changes to organization security policies). Org admins can view, search, and
        export these activities; some capabilities (like streaming) require higher
        plans.
      reference: https://support.atlassian.com/organization-administration/docs/track-organization-activities-from-the-audit-log/
  event_logs_licensing_level:
    value: Jira Cloud product audit logs are not available if all Jira Cloud products
