security_monitoring:
  event_logs:
    user_login:
      value: QuickBooks Online has a built-in Audit log that records user sign-ins
        and other account activity. Sign-outs are only logged when the user explicitly
        selects Sign out. The log includes date, user, event type, related entity
        details, and retains events for two years; access requires an admin.

    role_assignment:
      value: uncertain – official docs state the Audit log records changes to QuickBooks
        settings and account activity, but there is no explicit documentation confirming
        whether user role assignments/permission changes are specifically logged.
      reference: https://quickbooks.intuit.com/learn-support/en-us/help-article/audit-log/use-audit-log-quickbooks-online/L2WoVnW6I_US_en_US
    api_call:
      value: There is no company-facing security log of raw API calls. However, when
        third‑party apps connect and change data, those actions appear in the Audit
        log as System Administration events, providing a trace of app-driven changes.
      reference: https://quickbooks.intuit.com/learn-support/en-us/help-article/audit-log/use-audit-log-quickbooks-online/L2WoVnW6I_US_en_US
    data_export:
      value: uncertain – documentation does not specify whether data export/download
        actions are captured as audit events. The Audit log feature list does not
        mention export events.
      reference: https://quickbooks.intuit.com/learn-support/en-us/help-article/audit-log/use-audit-log-quickbooks-online/L2WoVnW6I_US_en_US

    user_account_creation:
      value: uncertain – while the Audit log differentiates actions by client vs.
        accounting firm users, official guidance does not explicitly confirm whether
        user invitations/creations are enumerated as distinct audit events.
      reference: https://quickbooks.intuit.com/learn-support/en-us/help-article/audit-log/clients-accountants-view-audit-log/L8wWnKPK3_US_en_US
    security_policy_change:
      value: uncertain – Intuit Account security (MFA/2‑step verification, authenticator)
        is managed in the Intuit Account portal; no documentation indicates these
        security preference changes are logged within the QuickBooks Online Audit
        log.

  log_export_options:
    tools_connectors:
      value: Official security/audit log export mechanisms are UI-based (view, print;
        CSV export availability varies per UI guidance) and there is no documented
        Audit log API or streaming feed. Business-data programmatic options exist
        (CDC, webhooks) but they are not security login/audit feeds. Third-party ETL/automation
        tools (e.g., CloudQuery, n8n, Tray) can move QBO business data into SIEMs;
        for Audit log specifically, manual UI export or community tools (e.g., CSV
        export extensions) are used.

incident_response:
  suspend_user_api:
    value: Uncertain—no public QuickBooks Online Accounting API for programmatically
      suspending or deleting end‑user accounts was found. User access is managed via
      the QuickBooks Online UI (Settings > Manage users) where admins can delete users;
      no vendor API reference documents list user‑management endpoints.

  invalidate_sessions_api:
    value: No QuickBooks Online API to invalidate a user’s active sessions was found.
      At the Intuit Account level (which QBO uses for identity), admins can take UI
      actions like disabling device-based sign-in (passkeys) and requesting deactivation
      of a user; deactivation signs the user out, but this is a manual UI flow, not
      an API.

      access.'
    reference: https://developers.intuit.com/app/developer/qbo/docs/develop/authentication-and-authorization/oauth-2.0
  user_toggle_api:
    value: Uncertain—no public API to toggle a user’s active/suspended state was found.
      In the UI, QuickBooks Online Advanced supports creating and deactivating custom
      roles and editing role access; documentation does not state whether changing
      roles immediately invalidates active sessions.

  user_status_api:
    value: Uncertain—public endpoints to query QuickBooks Online user status were
      not found. Intuit documents a User Role entity that can return role type and
      status (ACTIVE/INACTIVE), but it is explicitly described as a closed beta and
      not publicly available.
