  scim_authentication_acquisition_steps: "SCIM setup is typically done in conjunction with an Identity Provider like Okta or Azure AD. The setup involves enabling the SCIM API within the IdP's CrowdStrike application configuration. The IdP then generates an OAuth Bearer Token that is used for authenticating API requests to CrowdStrike's SCIM endpoint."

  user_management_api_authentication_acquisition_steps: "1. Log in to the Falcon console with an account that has the 'Falcon Administrator' role. 2. Navigate to 'Support and resources' -> 'API clients and keys'. 3. In the 'OAuth2 API clients' section, click 'Create API client'. 4. Provide a Client Name and Description. 5. Select the required API scopes, which must include 'User management' with at least 'Read' and 'Write' permissions. 6. Click 'Create'. 7. The system will generate a Client ID and a Client Secret. The Client Secret is only shown once and must be stored securely. 8. Use the Client ID and Client Secret to request an OAuth2 access token from the CrowdStrike API authentication endpoint. This token is then used in the Authorization header for subsequent API calls."
