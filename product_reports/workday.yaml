  sso_support:
    value: Workday supports SAML and OpenID Connect (OIDC) for Single Sign-On, allowing
      users to log in with their corporate credentials. [22] It can be configured for both
      Identity Provider (IdP) initiated and Service Provider (SP) initiated SSO flows.

  sso_licensing_level_requirement:
    value: Specific licensing SKUs are not publicly detailed, but SSO configuration
      is a standard feature for Workday customers. Integration with specific applications
      may require subscriptions like "Workday Cloud Connect for Learning (CCLRN) SKU"
      for platforms like Skillsoft Percipio. [30]

  scim_authentication_acquisition_steps: 'Workday does not provide a standard inbound
    SCIM 2.0 endpoint for user provisioning. Instead, it offers pre-built connectors
    and comprehensive APIs (SOAP and REST) for this purpose. [31] For example, Microsoft
    Entra ID provisions users into Workday via the Human Resources API, not SCIM. [14,
    40] Some connectors, like the "Account Provisioning Integration," can use SCIM
    to provision users *out* of Workday into other systems. [31]'

    value: Authentication token
    reference: https://community.workday.com/rest
  user_management_api_authentication_acquisition_steps: "To authenticate API requests, Workday\
    \ primarily uses OAuth 2.0, which is the recommended approach for REST APIs. [2,\

    \ search for the 'Create Integration System User' task and create a new user with\
    \ a username and password. [3, 17] This user will not have UI access. [17]\n2.\
    \  **Create a Security Group:** Search for the 'Create Security Group' task and\
    \ create an 'Integration System Security Group (Unconstrained)'. Assign the ISU\
    \ created in the previous step to this group. [17, 24]\n3.  **Configure Domain\
    \ Security Policy:** Search for 'Maintain Permissions for Security Group' and grant\
    \ the necessary 'Domain Security Policy Permissions' (e.g., Worker Data, Person\
    \ Data) to the security group with 'Get' and 'Put' access. [24, 33]\n4.  **Register\
    \ an API Client:** Search for the 'Register API Client for Integrations' task.\
    \ Provide a client name, set the grant type to 'Authorization Code Grant', and\
    \ select the required functional area scopes (e.g., Staffing, Organizations and\
    \ Roles). [1, 9]\n5.  **Generate Credentials:** Upon saving the client registration,\
    \ Workday will generate a **Client ID** and **Client Secret**. [8, 9]\n6.  **Generate\
    \ Refresh Token:** Search for the 'View API Client' task, find your client, and\
    \ from the menu, select 'Manage Refresh Tokens for Integrations'. Generate a non-expiring\
    \ **Refresh Token** for the ISU. [2]\n7.  **Obtain Access Token:** Use the Client\
    \ ID, Client Secret, and Refresh Token to make a POST request to the Workday\
    \ token endpoint to receive a bearer Access Token for subsequent API calls. [4,\

    value: Yes, Workday's security model, which includes User-Based Security Groups
      and Organization Roles, can be managed via its APIs. Specific API permissions,
      such as "User-Based Security Group Administration" (with GET/PUT access) and
      "Manage: Organization Roles" (with GET access), must be granted to the integration
      system user. This allows for programmatic assignment and management of user
      roles and group memberships. [33]
