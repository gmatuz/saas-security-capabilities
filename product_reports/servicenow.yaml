Navigate to 'System OAuth' > 'Application Registry' in the ServiceNow platform UI.\n3. Open the 'SCIM API' record. [5]\n4. Configure the OAuth policy for the SCIM API, typically using an OAuth OIDC provider configuration. [5]\n5. Create a dedicated service user account with the necessary roles to perform SCIM operations (e.g., roles for managing `sys_user` and `sys_user_group` tables). The 'snc_platform_rest_api_access' and SCIM-specific roles are required. [34]\n6.

Check the 'Web service access only' box on the user record to prevent UI logins and restrict usage to API interactions. [4]\n3. Assign the necessary roles to the user. At a minimum, roles like 'rest_service', 'snc_platform_rest_api_access', and roles granting CRUD permissions on the User (`sys_user`) and Group (`sys_user_group`) tables are required. [4]\n4. Use the username and password of this service account as credentials for Basic Authentication in the Authorization header of your API requests."
