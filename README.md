# saas-security-capabilities
Genai assembled (gemini 2.5pro with search), machine readable SaaS product security capability data
**Apache 2.0**, data is free to use but no guaantees of correctness

## Why?
When it comes to SaaS products there seem to be little consistency how different products implement different security capabilities, it is often painful to find out what is available under what licensing level.
Having this information is could valuable when picking products or rolling out enterprise security

## Purpose
Aim to collect information about the most important security capabilities of SaaS applications with some guidance for implementing/integrating the capailities
* user managment related capabilities (SSO, user lifecycle management): because most attacks on SaaS applications are idenity based
* security monitoring related capabilities: because, outside of AIM, detection is the only somewhat generically implementable control
* response capabilities: because users will get owned

## Contribution
please reach out if you would like to see products added, notice capabilities missing or inaccurate. also on the off chance that you would like to help expand the project or chip in for the costs
